    "rationale": "The correct answer is 403 . For a linear equation in one variable to have infinitely many solutions, the coefficients of the variable must be equal on both sides of the equation and the constant terms must also be equal on both sides of the equation. The given equation can be rewritten as StartFraction 4 left parenthesis 3 x plus 7 right parenthesis Over 4 EndFraction minus StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction equals r left parenthesis x minus 8 right parenthesis , or 3 x plus 7 minus StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction equals r left parenthesis x minus 8 right parenthesis . Applying the distributive property to the right-hand side of this equation yields 3 x plus 7 minus StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction equals r x minus 8 r . For this equation to have infinitely many solutions, the coefficients of x must be equal, so it follows that 3 equals r . Additionally, the constant terms must be equal, which means 7 minus StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction equals minus 8 r . Substituting 3 for r in this equation yields 7 minus StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction equals minus 8 left parenthesis 3 right parenthesis , or 7 minus StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction equals negative 24 . Adding StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction to both sides of this equation yields 7 equals negative 24 plus StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction . Adding 24 to both sides of this equation yields 31 equals StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction . Multiplying both sides of this equation by 13 yields 403 equals s .

During the 5-hour period, the auger removed corn from the bin at a constant rate of the fraction 4,650 over 5, equals 930 bushels per hour. Assuming the auger continues to remove corn at this rate, after x hours it will have removed 930x bushels of corn. Because the bin contained 24,000 bushels of corn when Hector started using the auger, the equation 24,000 – 930x = 12,840 can be used to find the number of hours, x, Hector will have been using the auger when 12,840 bushels of corn remain in the bin.

Adding 60 to both sides of this equation yields 15 equals b . Therefore, m equals 5 and b equals 15 . Substituting 5 for m and 15 for b in the equation y equals m x plus b yields y equals 5 x plus 15 . Thus, the equation y equals 5 x plus 15 represents the linear relationship between x and y . It’s also given that the graph of the linear equation representing this relationship passes through the point left parenthesis one fourth comma a right parenthesis . Substituting one fourth for x and a for y in the equation y equals 5 x plus 15 yields a equals 5 left parenthesis one fourth right parenthesis plus 15 , which is equivalent to a equals five fourths plus 15 , or a equals StartFraction 65 Over 4 EndFraction .

Since the company's revenue is 60 dollars per child, the total revenue from x children in this group was 60 x dollars. Since the company's revenue is 80 dollars per adult, the total revenue from y adults in this group was 80 y dollars.

It is given that the total number of tents was 60 and the total number of people in the group was 202. This situation can be expressed as a system of two equations, x plus y, equals 60 and 2 x plus 4 y, equals 202 . The first equation can be rewritten as y equals, negative x plus 60 . Substituting negative x plus 60 for y in the equation 2 x plus 4 y, equals 202 yields 2 x plus, 4 times, open parenthesis, negative x plus 60, close parenthesis, equals 202 . Distributing and combining like terms gives negative 2 x plus 240, equals 202 . Subtracting 240 from both sides of negative 2 x plus 240, equals 202 and then dividing both sides by negative 2 gives x equals 19 . Therefore, the number of 2-person tents is 19.Alternate approach: If each of the 60 tents held 4 people, the total number of people that could be accommodated in tents would be 240. However, the actual number of people who slept in tents was 202. The difference of 38 accounts for the 2-person tents. Since each of these tents holds 2 people fewer than a 4-person tent, thirty eight halves, equals 19 gives the number of 2-person tents.Choice A is incorrect. This choice may result from assuming exactly half of the tents hold 2 people. If that were true, then the total number of people who slept in tents would be 2 times 30, plus, 4 times 30, equals 180 ; however, the total number of people who slept in tents was 202, not 180. Choice B is incorrect. If 20 tents were 2-person tents, then the remaining 40 tents would be 4-person tents. Since all the tents were filled to capacity, the total number of people who slept in tents would be 2 times 20, plus, 4 times 40, equals, 40 plus 160, which equals 200 ; however, the total number of people who slept in tents was 202, not 200. Choice D is incorrect. If 18 tents were 2-person tents, then the remaining 42 tents would be 4-person tents. Since all the tents were filled to capacity, the total number of people who slept in tents would be 2 times 18, plus, 4 times 42, equals, 36 plus 168, which equals 204 ; however, the total number of people who slept in tents was 202, not 204.",

Since gasoline costs $4 per gallon, and since Alan’s car travels an average of 25 miles per gallon, the expression 4 over 25 gives the cost, in dollars per mile, to drive the car. Multiplying 4 over 25 by m gives the cost for Alan to drive m miles in his car.

Dividing both sides of this equation by negative 2 yields 8 equals t . Thus, if the system has no solution, the value of t is 8 . Alternate approach: A system of two linear equations in two variables, x and y , has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in the form upper A x plus upper B y equals upper C , where upper A , upper B , and upper C are constant terms, are parallel if the ratio of the x-coefficients is equal to the ratio of the y-coefficients, and distinct if the ratio of the x-coefficients are not equal to the ratio of the constant terms.

    "rationale": "Choice A is correct. It's given that there is a linear relationship between the number of cars, c , on a commuter train and the maximum number of passengers and crew, p , that the train can carry. It follows that this relationship can be represented by an equation of the form p equals m c plus b , where m is the rate of change of p in this relationship and b is a constant. The rate of change of p in this relationship can be calculated by dividing the difference in any two values of p by the difference in the corresponding values of c . Using two pairs of values given in the table, the rate of change of p in this relationship is StartFraction 284 minus 174 Over 5 minus 3 EndFraction , or 55 . Substituting 55 for m in the equation p equals m c plus b yields p equals 55 c plus b . The value of b can be found by substituting any value of c and its corresponding value of p for c and p , respectively, in this equation. Substituting 10 for c and 559 for p yields 559 equals 55 left parenthesis 10 right parenthesis plus b , or 559 equals 550 plus b . Subtracting 550 from both sides of this equation yields 9 equals b . Substituting 9 for b in the equation p equals 55 c plus b yields p equals 55 c plus 9 . Subtracting 9 from both sides of this equation yields p minus 9 equals 55 c . Subtracting p from both sides of this equation yields negative 9 equals 55 c minus p , or 55 c minus p equals negative 9 . Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.",

It's given that the sample has a total mass of 50.0 grams. Therefore, the equation x plus y equals 50.0 represents this situation. It's also given that the sample is 50.0 percent sign silicon by mass. Therefore, the total mass of the silicon in the sample is 0.500 left parenthesis 50.0 right parenthesis , or 25.0 , grams. It's also given that the first piece was 30.0 percent sign silicon by mass and the second piece was 80.0 percent sign silicon by mass.

If the height of the plant increased by an average of 1.20 centimeters per day for 12 days, then its total growth over the 12 days was 1 point 2 0, times 12, equals 14.4 centimeters. The plant was 36.8 centimeters tall after 12 days, so at the beginning of the study its height was 36 point 8, minus 14 point 4, equals 22 point 4 centimeters. Note that 22.4 and 112/5 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.Alternate approach: The equation 36 point 8 equals, 12, times, 1 point 2 0, plus h can be used to represent this situation, where h is the height of the plant, in centimeters, at the beginning of the study. Solving this equation for h yields 22.4 centimeters.",

It’s given that the owner pays dollar sign 4.90 per candle to purchase small candles and dollar sign 11.60 per candle to purchase large candles. Therefore, the owner pays 4.90 s dollars for s small candles and 11.60 script l dollars for script l large candles, which means the owner pays a total of 4.90 s plus 11.60 script l dollars to purchase candles. It’s given that the owner budgets dollar sign 2,200 to purchase candles. Therefore, 4.90 s plus 11.60 script l less than or equals 2,200 .

Subtracting script l from both sides of the inequality s plus script l greater than or equals 200 yields s greater than or equals 200 minus script l .

Subtracting 63 from each side of this inequality yields the inequality x greater than or equals 4 . Thus, the geologist needs to collect a minimum of 4 additional samples. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice B is incorrect. This is the number of samples the geologist has already collected, rather than the minimum number of additional samples the geologist needs to collect. Choice D is incorrect. If the geologist collects 0 additional samples, the geologist will have collected a total of 63 samples, which is less than 67 samples.",

    "correct_answer": "257",
    "rationale": "The correct answer is 257 . It’s given that a linear model estimates the population of a city from 1991 to 2015 . Since the population can be estimated using a linear model, it follows that there is a constant rate of change for the model. It’s also given that the model estimates the population was 57 thousand in 1991 , 224 thousand in 2011 , and x thousand in 2015 . The change in the population between 2011 and 1991 is 224 minus 57 , or 167 , thousand. The change in the number of years between 2011 and 1991 is 2011 minus 1991 , or 20 , years.

The change in the number of years between 2015 and 2011 is 2015 minus 2011 , or 4 , years.

Similarly, the same adult uses 150 b calories after bicycling for b 30-minute periods. Therefore, the equation 200 h plus 150 b, equals 1,900 represents the situation where a 160-pound adult uses a total of 1,900 calories from hiking for h 30-minute periods and bicycling for b 30-minute periods. It’s given that the adult completes 1 hour, or 2 30-minute periods, of bicycling. Substituting 2 for b in the equation 200 h plus 150 b, equals 1,900 yields 200 h plus, 150 times 2, equals 1,900 , or 200 h plus 300, equals 1,900 . Subtracting 300 from both sides of this equation yields 200 h equals 1,600 . Dividing both sides by 200 yields h equals 8 . Since h represents the number of 30-minute periods spent hiking and there are 2 30-minute periods in every hour, it follows that the adult will need to hike for the fraction eight over 2 , or 4 hours to use a total of 1,900 calories from bicycling and hiking.Choice A is incorrect and may result from solving the equation 200 h equals 1,900 . This represents 0 30-minute periods bicycling instead of 2. Choice B is incorrect and may result from solving the equation 200 h plus 150, equals 1,900 . This represents 1 30-minute period of bicycling instead of 2. Choice C is incorrect. This may result from determining that the number of 30-minute periods the adult should hike is 8, but then subtracting 2 from 8, rather than dividing 8 by 2, to find the number of hours the adult should hike.",

    "rationale": "Choice A is correct. Each of the choices is a linear equation in the form y = mx + b, where m and b are constants. In this equation, m represents the change in y for each increase in x by 1. From the table, it can be determined that the value of y increases by 2 for each increase in x by 1. In other words, for the pairs of x and y in the given table, m = 2. The value of b can be found by substituting the values of x and y from any row of the table and substituting the value of m into the equation y = mx + b and then solving for b. For example, using x = 1, y = 5, and m = 2 yields 5 = 2(1) + b. Solving for b yields b = 3. Therefore, the equation y = 2x + 3 could represent the relationship between x and y in the given table.Alternatively, if an equation represents the relationship between x and y, then when each pair of x and y from the table is substituted into the equation, the result will be a true statement. Of the equations given, the equation y = 2x + 3 in choice A is the only equation that results in a true statement when each of the pairs of x and y are substituted into the equation.Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because when at least one pair of x and y from the table is substituted into the equations given in these choices, the result is a false statement. For example, when the pair x = 4 and y = 11 is substituted into the equation in choice B, the result is 11 = 3(4) – 2, or 11 = 10, which is false.",

    "rationale": "The correct answer is 14 . Let x represent the first integer and y represent the second integer. If the first integer is 5 greater than twice the second integer, then x equals 2 y plus 5 . It's given that the product of the two integers is 462 ; therefore x y equals 462 . Substituting 2 y plus 5 for x in this equation yields left parenthesis 2 y plus 5 right parenthesis left parenthesis y right parenthesis equals 462 , which can be written as 2 y squared plus 5 y equals 462 . Subtracting 462 from each side of this equation yields 2 y squared plus 5 y minus 462 equals 0 . The left-hand side of this equation can be factored by finding two values whose product is 2 left parenthesis negative 462 right parenthesis , or negative 924 , and whose sum is 5 . The two values whose product is negative 924 and whose sum is 5 are 33 and negative 28 . Thus, the equation 2 y squared plus 5 y minus 462 equals 0 can be rewritten as 2 y squared minus 28 y plus 33 y minus 462 equals 0 , which is equivalent to 2 y left parenthesis y minus 14 right parenthesis plus 33 left parenthesis y minus 14 right parenthesis equals 0 , or left parenthesis 2 y plus 33 right parenthesis left parenthesis y minus 14 right parenthesis equals 0 . By the zero product property, it follows that 2 y plus 33 equals 0 or y minus 14 equals 0 . Subtracting 33 from both sides of the equation 2 y plus 33 equals 0 yields 2 y equals negative 33 . Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields y equals negative StartFraction 33 Over 2 EndFraction . Since y is a positive integer, the value of y isn't negative StartFraction 33 Over 2 EndFraction . Adding 14 to both sides of the equation y minus 14 equals 0 yields y equals 14 . Substituting 14 for y in the equation x y equals 462 yields x left parenthesis 14 right parenthesis equals 462 . Dividing both sides of this equation by 14 yields x equals 33 . Therefore, the two integers are 14 and 33 , so the smaller of the two integers is 14 .",

In this equation, b represents the time, in seconds, at which the softball reaches its maximum height of c meters above the ground. It's given that this softball reaches a maximum height of 51.84 meters above the ground at 1.8 seconds; therefore, b equals 1.8 and c equals 51.84 . Substituting 1.8 for b and 51.84 for c in the equation h equals minus a left parenthesis t minus b right parenthesis squared plus c yields h equals minus a left parenthesis t minus 1.8 right parenthesis squared plus 51.84 .

It follows that an equation representing the model can be written in the form f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k , where f left parenthesis x right parenthesis is the projectile's estimated height above the ground, in meters, x seconds after the launch, a is a constant, and k is the maximum height above the ground, in meters, the model estimates the projectile reached h seconds after the launch. It's given that the model estimates the projectile reached a maximum height of 51.1 meters above the ground 3 seconds after the launch. Therefore, k equals 51.1 and h equals 3 . Substituting 51.1 for k and 3 for h in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k yields f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 . It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of 7 meters above the ground. Therefore, when x equals 0 , f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 7 . Substituting 0 for x and 7 for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 yields 7 equals a left parenthesis 0 minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 , or 7 equals 9 a plus 51.1 . Subtracting 51.1 from both sides of this equation yields negative 44.1 equals 9 a . Dividing both sides of this equation by 9 yields negative 4.9 equals a . Substituting negative 4.9 for a in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 yields f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals minus 4.9 left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 . Therefore, the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals minus 4.9 left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground x seconds after it was launched. The number of seconds after the launch that the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of 7 meters is the value of x when f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 7 . Substituting 7 for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals minus 4.9 left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 yields 7 equals minus 4.9 left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 . Subtracting 51.1 from both sides of this equation yields negative 44.1 equals minus 4.9 left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared . Dividing both sides of this equation by negative 4.9 yields 9 equals left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields two equations: 3 equals x minus 3 and negative 3 equals x minus 3 . Adding 3 to both sides of the equation 3 equals x minus 3 yields 6 equals x . Adding 3 to both sides of the equation negative 3 equals x minus 3 yields 0 equals x . Since 0 seconds after the launch represents the time at which the projectile was launched, 6 must be the number of seconds the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of 7 meters. Alternate approach: It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of 7 meters above the ground and reached a maximum height of 51.1 meters above the ground 3 seconds after the launch. Since the model is quadratic, and quadratic functions are symmetric, the model estimates that for any given height less than the maximum height, the time the projectile takes to travel from the given height to the maximum height is the same as the time the projectile takes to travel from the maximum height back to the given height. Thus, since the model estimates the projectile took 3 seconds to travel from 7 meters above the ground to its maximum height of 51.1 meters above the ground, the model also estimates the projectile will take 3 more seconds to travel from its maximum height of 51.1 meters above the ground back to 7 meters above the ground. Thus, the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of 7 meters 3 seconds after it reaches its maximum height, which is 6 seconds after the launch. Choice A is incorrect. The model estimates that 3 seconds after the launch, the projectile reached a height of 51.1 meters, not 7 meters. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.",

Finally, if the value of b squared, minus 4 a, c is negative, then there will be no real solutions to the equation.The given equation 2 x squared, minus 4 x, equals t is a quadratic equation in one variable, where t is a constant. Subtracting t from both sides of the equation gives 2 x squared, minus 4 x, minus t, equals 0 . In this form, a, equals 2 , b equals negative 4 , and c equals negative t . The values of t for which the equation has no real solutions are the same values of t for which the discriminant of this equation is a negative value. The discriminant is equal to open parenthesis, negative 4, close parenthesis, squared, minus 4 times 2, times negative t ; therefore, open parenthesis, negative 4, close parenthesis, squared, minus, 4 times 2, times negative t, is less than 0 . Simplifying the left side of the inequality gives 16 plus 8, t, is less than 0 . Subtracting 16 from both sides of the inequality and then dividing both sides by 8 gives t is less than negative 2 . Of the values given in the options, negative 3 is the only value that is less than negative 2 . Therefore, choice A must be the correct answer.Choices B, C, and D are incorrect and may result from a misconception about how to use the discriminant to determine the number of solutions of a quadratic equation in one variable.",

Multiplying StartFraction 55 squared Over 4 EndFraction by four fourths in this equation to get a common denominator yields f left parenthesis StartFraction 55 Over 4 EndFraction right parenthesis equals 4 left parenthesis StartFraction 55 squared Over 4 squared EndFraction right parenthesis minus 2 left parenthesis StartFraction 55 squared Over 4 squared EndFraction right parenthesis , or f left parenthesis StartFraction 55 Over 4 EndFraction right parenthesis equals 2 left parenthesis StartFraction 55 squared Over 4 squared EndFraction right parenthesis , which is equivalent to f left parenthesis StartFraction 55 Over 4 EndFraction right parenthesis equals 2 left parenthesis StartFraction 55 Over 4 EndFraction right parenthesis squared . Thus, the maximum value of f left parenthesis t right parenthesis is 2 left parenthesis StartFraction 55 Over 4 EndFraction right parenthesis squared . Since the equation defining g left parenthesis t right parenthesis is g left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals f left parenthesis t right parenthesis plus 3 , the maximum value of g left parenthesis t right parenthesis is 3 greater than the maximum value of f left parenthesis t right parenthesis . It follows that the maximum value of g left parenthesis t right parenthesis is 3 plus 2 left parenthesis StartFraction 55 Over 4 EndFraction right parenthesis squared .

In the given equation, x squared minus 34 x plus c equals 0 , a equals 1 and b equals negative 34 . Therefore, the discriminant of the given equation can be expressed as left parenthesis negative 34 right parenthesis squared minus 4 left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis left parenthesis c right parenthesis , or 1,156 minus 4 c . It follows that the given equation has no real solutions when 1,156 minus 4 c less than 0 . Adding 4 c to both sides of this inequality yields 1,156 less than 4 c . Dividing both sides of this inequality by 4 yields 289 less than c , or c greater than 289 . It's given that the equation x squared minus 34 x plus c equals 0 has no real solutions when c greater than n . Therefore, the least possible value of n is 289 .",

Since each choice has a term of 3 x squared , which can be written as left parenthesis 3 x right parenthesis left parenthesis x right parenthesis , and each choice has a term of 14 b , which can be written as left parenthesis 7 right parenthesis left parenthesis 2 b right parenthesis , the expression that has a factor of x plus 2 b , where b is a positive integer constant, can be represented as left parenthesis 3 x plus 7 right parenthesis left parenthesis x plus 2 b right parenthesis . Using the distributive property of multiplication, this expression is equivalent to 3 x left parenthesis x plus 2 b right parenthesis plus 7 left parenthesis x plus 2 b right parenthesis , or 3 x squared plus 6 x b plus 7 x plus 14 b . Combining the x-terms in this expression yields 3 x squared plus left parenthesis 7 plus 6 b right parenthesis x plus 14 b . It follows that the coefficient of the x-term is equal to 7 plus 6 b . Thus, from the given choices, 7 plus 6 b must be equal to 7 , 28 , 42 , or 49 .

    "rationale": "Choice B is correct. Let x be the first integer and let y be the second integer. If the first integer is 11 greater than twice the second integer, then x equals 2 y plus 11 . If the product of the two integers is 546 , then x y equals 546 . Substituting 2 y plus 11 for x in this equation results in left parenthesis 2 y plus 11 right parenthesis y equals 546 . Distributing the y to both terms in the parentheses results in 2 y squared plus 11 y equals 546 . Subtracting 546 from both sides of this equation results in 2 y squared plus 11 y minus 546 equals 0 . The left-hand side of this equation can be factored by finding two values whose product is 2 left parenthesis negative 546 right parenthesis , or negative 1,092 , and whose sum is 11 . The two values whose product is negative 1,092 and whose sum is 11 are 39 and negative 28 . Thus, the equation 2 y squared plus 11 y minus 546 equals 0 can be rewritten as 2 y squared plus 28 y minus 39 y minus 546 equals 0 , which is equivalent to 2 y left parenthesis y minus 14 right parenthesis plus 39 left parenthesis y minus 14 right parenthesis equals 0 , or left parenthesis 2 y plus 39 right parenthesis left parenthesis y minus 14 right parenthesis equals 0 . By the zero product property, it follows that 2 y plus 39 equals 0 and y minus 14 equals 0 . Subtracting 39 from both sides of the equation 2 y plus 39 equals 0 yields 2 y equals negative 39 . Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields y equals negative StartFraction 39 Over 2 EndFraction . Since y is a positive integer, the value of y is not negative StartFraction 39 Over 2 EndFraction . Adding 14 to both sides of the equation y minus 14 equals 0 yields y equals 14 . Substituting 14 for y in the equation x y equals 546 yields x left parenthesis 14 right parenthesis equals 546 . Dividing both sides of this equation by 14 results in x equals 39 . Therefore, the two integers are 14 and 39 , so the smaller of the two integers is 14 . Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect. This is the larger of the two integers. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.",

The equation of a quadratic function can be written in the form f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k , where a , h , and k are constants. It’s given in the table that when x equals negative 1 , the corresponding value of f left parenthesis x right parenthesis is 10 . Substituting negative 1 for x and 10 for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k gives 10 equals a left parenthesis negative 1 minus h right parenthesis squared plus k , which is equivalent to 10 equals a left parenthesis 1 plus 2 h plus h squared right parenthesis plus k , or 10 equals a plus 2 a h plus a h squared plus k . It’s given in the table that when x equals 0 , the corresponding value of f left parenthesis x right parenthesis is 14 . Substituting 0 for x and 14 for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k gives 14 equals a left parenthesis 0 minus h right parenthesis squared plus k , or 14 equals a h squared plus k .

Substituting 1 for x and 20 for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k gives 20 equals a left parenthesis 1 minus h right parenthesis squared plus k , which is equivalent to 20 equals a left parenthesis 1 minus 2 h plus h squared right parenthesis plus k , or 20 equals a minus 2 a h plus a h squared plus k . Adding 20 equals a minus 2 a h plus a h squared plus k to the equation 10 equals a plus 2 a h plus a h squared plus k gives 30 equals 2 a plus 2 a h squared plus 2 k . Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 gives 15 equals a plus a h squared plus k . Since 14 equals a h squared plus k , substituting 14 for a h squared plus k into the equation 15 equals a plus a h squared plus k gives 15 equals a plus 14 . Subtracting 14 from both sides of this equation gives a equals 1 . Substituting 1 for a in the equations 14 equals a h squared plus k and 20 equals a h squared minus 2 a h plus a plus k gives 14 equals h squared plus k and 20 equals 1 minus 2 h plus h squared plus k , respectively. Since 14 equals h squared plus k , substituting 14 for h squared plus k in the equation 20 equals 1 minus 2 h plus h squared plus k gives 20 equals 1 minus 2 h plus 14 , or 20 equals 15 minus 2 h . Subtracting 15 from both sides of this equation gives 5 equals minus 2 h . Dividing both sides of this equation by negative 2 gives negative five halves equals h . Substituting negative five halves for h into the equation 14 equals h squared plus k gives 14 equals left parenthesis negative five halves right parenthesis squared plus k , or 14 equals StartFraction 25 Over 4 EndFraction plus k .

The equation of a parabola in the xy-plane can be written in the form y equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k , where a is a constant and left parenthesis h comma k right parenthesis is the vertex of the parabola. If a is positive, the parabola will open upward, and if a is negative, the parabola will open downward. It’s given that the parabola has vertex left parenthesis 9 comma negative 14 right parenthesis . Substituting 9 for h and negative 14 for k in the equation y equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k gives y equals a left parenthesis x minus 9 right parenthesis squared minus 14 , which can be rewritten as y equals a left parenthesis x minus 9 right parenthesis left parenthesis x minus 9 right parenthesis minus 14 , or y equals a left parenthesis x squared minus 18 x plus 81 right parenthesis minus 14 . Distributing the factor of a on the right-hand side of this equation yields y equals a x squared minus 18 a x plus 81 a minus 14 . Therefore, the equation of the parabola, y equals a x squared minus 18 a x plus 81 a minus 14 , can be written in the form y equals a x squared plus b x plus c , where a equals a , b equals minus 18 a , and c equals 81 a minus 14 . Substituting minus 18 a for b and 81 a minus 14 for c in the expression a plus b plus c yields left parenthesis a right parenthesis plus left parenthesis minus 18 a right parenthesis plus left parenthesis 81 a minus 14 right parenthesis , or 64 a minus 14 . Since the vertex of the parabola, left parenthesis 9 comma negative 14 right parenthesis , is below the x-axis, and it’s given that the parabola intersects the x-axis at two points, the parabola must open upward. Therefore, the constant a must have a positive value. Setting the expression 64 a minus 14 equal to the value in choice D yields 64 a minus 14 equals negative 12 . Adding 14 to both sides of this equation yields 64 a equals 2 . Dividing both sides of this equation by 64 yields a equals two sixty fourths , which is a positive value. Therefore, if the equation of the parabola is written in the form y equals a x squared plus b x plus c , where a , b , and c are constants, the value of a plus b plus c could be negative 12 . Choice A is incorrect. If the equation of a parabola with a vertex at left parenthesis 9 comma negative 14 right parenthesis is written in the form y equals a x squared plus b x plus c , where a , b , and c are constants and a plus b plus c equals negative 23 , then the value of a will be negative, which means the parabola will open downward, not upward, and will intersect the x-axis at zero points, not two points. Choice B is incorrect. If the equation of a parabola with a vertex at left parenthesis 9 comma negative 14 right parenthesis is written in the form y equals a x squared plus b x plus c , where a , b , and c are constants and a plus b plus c equals negative 19 , then the value of a will be negative, which means the parabola will open downward, not upward, and will intersect the x-axis at zero points, not two points. Choice C is incorrect. If the equation of a parabola with a vertex at left parenthesis 9 comma negative 14 right parenthesis is written in the form y equals a x squared plus b x plus c , where a , b , and c are constants and a plus b plus c equals negative 14 , then the value of a will be 0 , which is inconsistent with the equation of a parabola.",

    "rationale": "Choice B is correct. Let x be the number of years after 1985. It follows that x over 2 represents the number of 2-year periods that will occur within an x-year period. According to Moore’s law, every 2 years, the number of transistors included on microprocessors is estimated to double. Therefore, x years after 1985, the number of transistors will double x over 2 times. Since the number of transistors included on a microprocessor was 275,000, or .275 million, in 1985, the estimated number of transistors, in millions, included x years after 1985 can be modeled as 0 point 2 7 5 times 2 raised to the x over 2 power . The year in which the number of transistors is estimated to be 1.1 million is represented by the value of x when 1 point 1 equals, 0 point 2 7 5, times 2 raised to the x over 2 power . Dividing both sides of this equation by .275 yields 4 equals, 2 raised to the x over 2 power , which can be rewritten as 2 squared equals, 2 raised to the x over 2 power . Since the exponential equation has equal bases on each side, it follows that the exponents must also be equal: 2 equals x over 2 . Multiplying both sides of the equation 2 equals x over 2 by 2 yields x equals 4 . Therefore, according to Moore’s law, 4 years after 1985, or in 1989, the number of transistors included on microprocessors is estimated to reach 1.1 million.Alternate approach: According to Moore’s law, 2 years after 1985 (in 1987), the number of transistors included on a microprocessor is estimated to be 2 times 275,000 , or 550,000, and 2 years after 1987 (in 1989), the number of transistors included on microprocessors is estimated to be 2 times 550,000 , or 1,100,000. Therefore, the year that Moore’s law estimates the number of transistors on microprocessors to reach 1.1 million is 1989.Choices A, C, and D are incorrect. According to Moore’s law, the number of transistors included on microprocessors is estimated to reach 550,000 in 1987, 2.2 million in 1991, and about 6.2 million in 1994.",

The model also predicts that each year for the next 5 years, the population increased by 4 percent sign of the previous year's population. The predicted population in one of these years can be found by multiplying the predicted population from the previous year by 1.04 .

Since d is measured in hundreds of meters, it also follows that the number of brachiopod species changes by a fixed percentage for each increase in ocean depth by 100 meters. Since the base of the exponent in the model is 0.90, which is less than 1, the number of brachiopod species decreases as the ocean depth increases. Specifically, the number of brachiopod species at a depth of d plus 100 meters is 90% of the number of brachiopod species at a depth of d meters. This means that for each increase in ocean depth by 100 meters, the number of brachiopod species decreases by 10%.Choices A and C are incorrect. These describe situations where the number of brachiopod species are decreasing linearly rather than exponentially. Choice B is incorrect and results from interpreting the decrease in the number of brachiopod species as 10% for every 1-meter increase in ocean depth rather than for every 100-meter increase in ocean depth.",

It's also given that the table shows three values of x and their corresponding values of y , where y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis plus 4 . Substituting a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in this equation yields y equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k plus 4 . This equation represents a quadratic relationship between x and y , where k plus 4 is either the maximum or the minimum value of y , which occurs when x equals h .

It's given that a quadratic function models the height, in feet, of an object above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after the object is launched off an elevated surface. This quadratic function can be defined by an equation of the form f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k , where f left parenthesis x right parenthesis is the height of the object x seconds after it was launched, and a , h , and k are constants such that the function reaches its maximum value, k , when x equals h . Since the model indicates the object reaches its maximum height of 1,034 feet above the ground 8 seconds after being launched, f left parenthesis x right parenthesis reaches its maximum value, 1,034 , when x equals 8 . Therefore, k equals 1,034 and h equals 8 . Substituting 8 for h and 1,034 for k in the function f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k yields f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus 8 right parenthesis squared plus 1,034 . Since the model indicates the object has an initial height of 10 feet above the ground, the value of f left parenthesis x right parenthesis is 10 when x equals 0 . Substituting 0 for x and 10 for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus 8 right parenthesis squared plus 1,034 yields 10 equals a left parenthesis 0 minus 8 right parenthesis squared plus 1,034 , or 10 equals 64 a plus 1,034 .

Therefore, the discriminant of the equation 0 equals x squared plus 8 x plus a plus 1.5 is left parenthesis 8 right parenthesis squared minus 4 left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis left parenthesis a plus 1.5 right parenthesis , or 58 minus 4 a . Setting the discriminant equal to 0 to solve for a yields 58 minus 4 a equals 0 . Adding 4 a to both sides of this equation yields 58 equals 4 a . Dividing both sides of this equation by 4 yields StartFraction 58 Over 4 EndFraction equals a , or StartFraction 29 Over 2 EndFraction equals a . Therefore, if the given system of equations has exactly one distinct real solution, the value of a is StartFraction 29 Over 2 EndFraction . Note that 29/2 and 14.5 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.",

Substituting 0 for f of x in the given equation yields 0 equals, open parenthesis, x plus 4, close parenthesis, times, open parenthesis, x minus 1, close parenthesis, times, open parenthesis, 2 x minus 3, close parenthesis . By the zero product property, if 0 equals, open parenthesis, x plus 4, close parenthesis, times, open parenthesis, x minus 1, close parenthesis, times, open parenthesis, 2 x minus 3, close parenthesis , then x plus 4, equals 0 , x minus 1, equals 0 , or 2 x minus 3, equals 0 . Solving each of these linear equations for x, it follows that x equals negative 4 , x equals 1 , and x equals three halves , respectively. This means that the graph of the function f in the xy-plane has three x-intercepts: the point with coordinates negative 4 comma 0 , the point with coordinates 1 comma 0 , and the point with coordinates three halves comma 0 . Therefore, the point with coordinates negative two thirds comma 0 isn’t an x-intercept of the graph of the function f.Alternate approach: Substitution may be used. Since by definition an x-intercept of any graph is a point in the form k comma 0 where k is a constant, and since all points in the options are in this form, it need only be checked whether the points in the options lie on the graph of the function f. Substituting negative two thirds for x and 0 for f of x in the given equation yields 0 equals, open parenthesis, negative two thirds plus 4, close parenthesis, times, open parenthesis, negative two thirds minus 1, close parenthesis, times, open parenthesis, 2 times negative two thirds, minus 3, close parenthesis , or 0 equals, the fraction 650 over 27 . Therefore, the point with coordinates negative two thirds comma 0 doesn’t lie on the graph of the function f and can’t be an x-intercept of the graph.Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because each of these points is an x-intercept of the graph of the function f in the xy-plane. By definition, an x-intercept is a point on the graph of the form k comma 0 , where k is a constant. Substituting negative 4 for x and 0 for f of x in the given equation yields 0 equals, open parenthesis, negative 4 plus 4, close parenthesis, times, open parenthesis, negative 4 minus 1, close parenthesis, times, open parenthesis, 2 times negative 4, minus 3, close parenthesis , or 0 equals 0 . Since this is a true statement, the point with coordinates negative 4 comma 0 lies on the graph of the function f and is an x-intercept of the graph. Performing similar substitution using the points with coordinates 1 comma 0 and three halves comma 0 also yields the true statement 0 equals 0 , illustrating that these points also lie on the graph of the function f and are x-intercepts of the graph.",

Therefore, function g can be expressed in vertex form as g left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis t minus 6 right parenthesis squared plus 302.4 , where a is a constant. Since it's also given that the seal reached the surface of the water after 12 minutes, g left parenthesis 12 right parenthesis equals 0 .

Therefore, the model can be represented by an exponential equation of the form upper C equals upper K a Superscript t , where upper C is the estimated number of comments on the article t hours after the article was first featured on the home page and upper K and a are constants. It's also given that when the article was first featured on the home page of the news website, there were 40 comments on the article. This means that when t equals 0 , upper C equals 40 . Substituting 0 for t and 40 for upper C in the equation upper C equals upper K a Superscript t yields 40 equals upper K a Superscript 0 , or 40 equals upper K . It's also given that the number of comments on the article at the end of an hour had increased by 190 percent sign of the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour.

Substituting 1 for t , 116 for upper C , and 40 for upper K in the equation upper C equals upper K a Superscript t yields 116 equals 40 a Superscript 1 , or 116 equals 40 a .

    "rationale": "The correct answer is 8. The values of f of x for the exponential function f shown in the table increase by a factor of a, to the fourth power for each increase of 1 in x. This relationship can be represented by the equation f of x equals, a, raised to the 4 x plus b power , where b is a constant. It’s given that when x equals 2 , f of x equals, a, to the fifth power . Substituting 2 for x and a, to the fifth power for f of x into f of x equals, a, raised to the 4 x plus b power yields a, to the fifth power equals, a, raised to the 4 times 2, plus b power . Since 4 times 2, plus b, equals 5 , it follows that b equals negative 3 . Thus, an equation that defines the function f is f of x equals, a, raised to the 4 x minus 3 power . It follows that the value of k such that f of k equals, a, to the twenty ninth power can be found by solving the equation 4 k minus 3, equals 29 , which yields k equals 8 .",

The line of best fit shown for data set E has a y-intercept at approximately left parenthesis 0 comma 12 right parenthesis . It's given that data set F is created by multiplying the y-coordinate of each data point from data set E by 3.9 . It follows that a line of best fit for data set F has a y-intercept at approximately left parenthesis 0 comma 12 left parenthesis 3.9 right parenthesis right parenthesis , or left parenthesis 0 comma 46.8 right parenthesis . Therefore, the value of a is approximately 46.8 . The slope of a line that passes through points left parenthesis x 1 comma y 1 right parenthesis and left parenthesis x 2 comma y 2 right parenthesis can be calculated as StartFraction y 2 minus y 1 Over x 2 minus x 1 EndFraction .

    "rationale": "Choice A is correct. The median is the middle value in a data set when the data are arranged in order from least to greatest. Since there are 15 values in data set A, the median is the 8th value. The 8th value is 23 , so the median of data set A is 23 . The range is found by subtracting the minimum value in a data set from the maximum value. The minimum value in data set A is 22 and the maximum value is 26 . Therefore, the range of data set A is 26 minus 22 , or 4 . It’s given that data set B is created by adding 46 to each of the values in data set A. Therefore, the 8th value in data set B is 23 plus 46 , or 69 , so the median of data set B is 69 . The minimum value in data set B is 22 plus 46 , or 68 , and the maximum value is 26 plus 46 , or 72 . Therefore, the range of data set B is 72 minus 68 , or 4 . Since the median of data set A is 23 , and the median of data set B is 69 , the median of data set B is greater than the median of data set A. Since the ranges of data sets A and B are both 4 , the range of data set B is equal to the range of data set A. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

The median of a data set with an odd number of elements is the middle element when the elements are in numerical order. For 13 elements in numerical order, this is the 7th element. For this data set, the first 4 elements have a value of 1 , and the next 5 elements have a value of 2 . Thus, the 7th element in the ordered data set is 2 and the median number of bursts for the original data set is 2 . If an additional eruption with 11 bursts is added to this data set to create a new data set of 14 eruptions, the median of the new data set will be between the 7th and 8th elements in the ordered set, which will also be 2 . Therefore, the median number of bursts for the new data set will be the same as the median number of bursts for the original data set. The mean number of bursts for the original data set is found by adding the values of all 13 elements and dividing that sum by the number of elements, 13 . Since the data is shown in a dot plot, the sum of the values of the elements can be found by multiplying each element's value by its frequency: 1 left parenthesis 4 right parenthesis plus 2 left parenthesis 5 right parenthesis plus 3 left parenthesis 2 right parenthesis plus 4 left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis plus 5 left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis , or 29 . Therefore, the mean number of bursts for the original data set is StartFraction 29 Over 13 EndFraction .

Since StartFraction 40 Over 14 EndFraction greater than StartFraction 29 Over 13 EndFraction , the mean number of bursts for the new data set is greater than the mean number of bursts for the original data set. Therefore, of the median number of bursts and the mean number of bursts, only the mean number of bursts is greater for the new data set than for the original data set.

The line of best fit for a set of data is a linear equation that minimizes the distances from the data points to the line. An equation for the line of best fit can be written in slope-intercept form, y equals, m x plus b , where m is the slope of the graph of the line and b is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph. Since, for the data shown, the y-values increase as the x-values increase, the slope of a line of best fit must be positive. The data shown lie almost in a line, so the slope can be roughly estimated using the formula for slope, m equals, the fraction with numerator y sub 2 minus y sub 1, and denominator x sub 2 minus x sub 1, end fraction . The leftmost and rightmost data points have coordinates of about 1 comma 4 and 8 comma 26 , so the slope is approximately the fraction with numerator 26 minus 4, and denominator 8 minus 1, end fraction, equals the fraction 22 over 7 , which is a little greater than 3.

Since 34.6% of 26 is 8.996, there must have been 9 students in the class who reported having at least two siblings and 17 students who reported that they had fewer than two siblings. It is also given that the average eighth-grade class size in the state is 26 and that Mr. Camp’s class is representative of all eighth-grade classes in the state. This means that in each eighth-grade class in the state there are about 17 students who have fewer than two siblings. Therefore, the best estimate of the number of eighth-grade students in the state who have fewer than two siblings is 17 × (number of eighth-grade classes in the state), or 17 times 1,800, equals 30,600 .Choice A is incorrect because 16,200 is the best estimate for the number of eighth-grade students in the state who have at least, not fewer than, two siblings. Choice B is incorrect because 23,400 is half of the estimated total number of eighth-grade students in the state; however, since the students in Mr. Camp’s class are representative of students in the eighth-grade classes in the state and more than half of the students in Mr. Camp’s class have fewer than two siblings, more than half of the students in each eighth-grade class in the state have fewer than two siblings, too.

This can be written as a proportion: StartFraction length Over width EndFraction equals StartFraction 35 Over 10 EndFraction , or StartFraction script l Over w EndFraction equals StartFraction 35 Over 10 EndFraction . This proportion can be rewritten as 10 script l equals 35 w , or script l equals 3.5 w . If the width of the rectangular region increases by 7 , then the length will increase by some number x in order to maintain this ratio. The value of x can be found by replacing script l with script l plus x and w with w plus 7 in the equation, which gives script l plus x equals 3.5 left parenthesis w plus 7 right parenthesis . This equation can be rewritten using the distributive property as script l plus x equals 3.5 w plus 24.5 . Since script l equals 3.5 w , the right-hand side of this equation can be rewritten by substituting script l for 3.5 w , which gives script l plus x equals script l plus 24.5 , or x equals 24.5 . Therefore, if the width of the rectangular region increases by 7 units, the length must increase by 24.5 units in order to maintain the given ratio. Choice A is incorrect. If the width of the rectangular region increases, the length must also increase, not decrease. Choice C is incorrect. If the width of the rectangular region increases, the length must also increase, not decrease. Choice D is incorrect. Since the ratio of the length to the width of the rectangular region is 35 to 10 , if the width of the rectangular region increases by 7 units, the length would have to increase by a proportional amount, which would have to be greater than 7 units.",

It's given that the perimeter of this triangle is 18 plus 18 StartRoot 2 EndRoot inches. Thus, x left parenthesis 2 plus StartRoot 2 EndRoot right parenthesis equals 18 plus 18 StartRoot 2 EndRoot . Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 plus StartRoot 2 EndRoot yields x equals StartFraction 18 plus 18 StartRoot 2 EndRoot Over 2 plus StartRoot 2 EndRoot EndFraction . Multiplying the right-hand side of this equation by StartFraction 2 minus StartRoot 2 EndRoot Over 2 minus StartRoot 2 EndRoot EndFraction yields x equals StartFraction 36 plus 36 StartRoot 2 EndRoot minus 18 StartRoot 2 EndRoot minus 36 Over 2 EndFraction , or x equals 9 StartRoot 2 EndRoot .

Choice A is incorrect. If this were the length of the hypotenuse, the perimeter would be 9 plus 9 StartRoot 2 EndRoot inches. Choice B is incorrect. This is the length, in inches, of a leg of this triangle, not the hypotenuse. Choice D is incorrect. If this were the length of the hypotenuse, the perimeter would be 36 plus 18 StartRoot 2 EndRoot inches.",

    "rationale": "Choice B is correct. Because segments OA and OB are radii of the circle centered at point O, these segments have equal lengths. Therefore, triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle, where angles OAB and OBA are congruent base angles of the triangle. It’s given that angle OAB measures 30 degrees . Therefore, angle OBA also measures 30 degrees . Let x degrees represent the measure of angle AOB. Since the sum of the measures of the three angles of any triangle is 180 degrees , it follows that 30 degrees plus 30 degrees, plus x degrees, equals 180 degrees , or 60 degrees plus x degrees, equals 180 degrees . Subtracting 60 degrees from both sides of this equation yields x degrees equals 120 degrees , or the fraction 2 pi over 3 radians. Therefore, the measure of angle AOB, and thus the measure of arc A, B , is the fraction 2 pi over 3 radians. Since the line segment O C is a radius of the given circle and its length is 18, the length of the radius of the circle is 18. Therefore, the length of arc A, B can be calculated as the fraction 2 pi over 3, end fraction, times 18 , or 12 pi .Choices A, C, and D are incorrect and may result from conceptual or computational errors.",

Therefore, triangle upper A upper B upper C is a right triangle, and line segment upper A upper C is the hypotenuse of the triangle. It's also given that cosine upper A equals three fifths . Since the cosine of an acute angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle to the length of the hypotenuse, the ratio of the length of line segment upper A upper B to the length of line segment upper A upper C is 3 to 5 . It follows that the length of line segment upper A upper B can be represented as 3 a and the length of line segment upper A upper C can be represented as 5 a , where a is a constant. The Pythagorean theorem states that the sum of the squares of the length of the legs of a right triangle is equal to the square of the length of its hypotenuse, so it follows that upper A upper B squared plus upper B upper C squared equals upper A upper C squared . Substituting 3 a for upper A upper B and 5 a for upper A upper C in this equation yields left parenthesis 3 a right parenthesis squared plus upper B upper C squared equals left parenthesis 5 a right parenthesis squared , or 9 a squared plus upper B upper C squared equals 25 a squared .

It follows that the ratio of the length of line segment upper A upper B to the length of line segment upper B upper C is 3 to 4 . Let x represent the length, in millimeters, of line segment upper A upper B . It's given that the length of line segment upper B upper C is 136 millimeters. Since the ratio of the length of line segment upper A upper B to the length of line segment upper B upper C is 3 to 4 , StartFraction x Over 136 EndFraction equals three fourths .

It’s given that the logo is in the shape of a trapezoid that consists of three congruent equilateral triangles, and that the perimeter of the trapezoid is 20 centimeters (cm).

In the figure shown, the angle measuring y degree is congruent to its vertical angle formed by lines s and m , so the measure of the vertical angle is also y degree . The vertical angle forms a same-side interior angle pair with the angle measuring x degree . It's given that lines r and s are parallel. Therefore, same-side interior angles in the figure are supplementary, which means the sum of the measure of the vertical angle and the measure of the angle measuring x degree is 180 degree , or x plus y equals 180 . Subtracting x from both sides of this equation yields y equals 180 minus x . Substituting 180 minus x for y in the inequality y less than 65 yields 180 minus x less than 65 . Adding x to both sides of this inequality yields 180 less than 65 plus x . Subtracting 65 from both sides of this inequality yields 115 less than x , or x greater than 115 .

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is correct. The hypotenuse of triangle upper R upper S upper T is the longest side and is across from the right angle. The longest side length given is 584 , which is the length of side upper T upper R . Therefore, the hypotenuse of triangle upper R upper S upper T is side upper T upper R , so the right angle is angle upper S . The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side, which is the side across from the angle, to the length of the adjacent side, which is the side closest to the angle that is not the hypotenuse. It follows that the opposite side of angle upper T is side upper R upper S and the adjacent side of angle upper T is side upper S upper T . Therefore, tangent upper T equals StartFraction upper R upper S Over upper S upper T EndFraction . Substituting 440 for upper R upper S and 384 for upper S upper T in this equation yields tangent upper T equals StartFraction 440 Over 384 EndFraction . This is equivalent to tangent upper T equals StartFraction 55 Over 48 EndFraction . It’s given that triangle upper R upper S upper T is similar to triangle upper U upper V upper W , where upper S corresponds to upper V and upper T corresponds to upper W . It follows that upper R corresponds to upper U . Therefore, the hypotenuse of triangle upper U upper V upper W is side upper W upper U , which means tangent upper W equals StartFraction upper U upper V Over upper V upper W EndFraction . Since the lengths of corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional, StartFraction upper R upper S Over upper S upper T EndFraction equals StartFraction upper U upper V Over upper V upper W EndFraction . Therefore, tangent upper W equals StartFraction upper U upper V Over upper V upper W EndFraction is equivalent to tangent upper W equals StartFraction upper R upper S Over upper S upper T EndFraction , or tangent upper W equals tangent upper T . Thus, tangent upper W equals StartFraction 55 Over 48 EndFraction . Choice A is incorrect. This is the value of cosine upper W , not tangent upper W . Choice B is incorrect. This is the value of sine upper W , not tangent upper W . Choice C is incorrect. This is the value of StartFraction 1 Over tangent upper W EndFraction , not tangent upper W .",

It’s given that the area of triangle ABC is at least 48 but no more than 60. It follows that 48 is less than or equal to 6 y, which is less than or equal to 60 . Dividing by 6 to isolate y in this compound inequality yields 8 is less than or equal to y, which is less than or equal to 10 . Since y is an integer, y equals 8, 9, or 10 . In the given figure, the two right triangles shown are similar because they have two pairs of congruent angles: their respective right angles and angle A. Therefore, the following proportion is true: the fraction x over y equals the fraction 5 over 12 . Substituting 8 for y in the proportion results in the fraction x over 8 equals the fraction 5 over 12 . Cross multiplying and solving for x yields the fraction 10 over 3 .

It's also given that a copy of the poster is made in which the length and width of the original poster are each increased by 20 percent sign .

    "rationale": "Choice D is correct. It's given that the radius of the circle is 168 millimeters. Since points upper M and upper N both lie on the circle, segments upper G upper M and upper G upper N are both radii. Therefore, segments upper G upper M and upper G upper N each have length 168 millimeters. Two segments that are tangent to a circle and have a common exterior endpoint have equal length. Therefore, segment upper M upper H and segment upper N upper H have equal length. Let x represent the length of segment upper M upper H . Then x also represents the length of segment upper N upper H . It's given that the perimeter of quadrilateral upper G upper M upper H upper N is 3,856 millimeters. Since the perimeter of a quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral, 3,856 equals 168 plus 168 plus x plus x , or 3,856 equals 336 plus 2 x . Subtracting 336 from both sides of this equation yields 3,520 equals 2 x , and dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields 1,760 equals x . Therefore, the length of segment upper M upper H is 1,760 millimeters. A line segment that's tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of tangency. Therefore, segment upper G upper M is perpendicular to segment upper M upper H . Since perpendicular segments form right angles, angle upper G upper M upper H is a right angle. Therefore, triangle upper G upper M upper H is a right triangle with legs of length 1,760 millimeters and 168 millimeters, and hypotenuse upper G upper H . By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length c and legs with lengths a and b , then a squared plus b squared equals c squared . Substituting 1,760 for a and 168 for b in this equation yields 1,760 squared plus 168 squared equals c squared , or 3,125,824 equals c squared . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields plus or minus 1,768 equals c . Since c represents a length, which must be positive, the value of c is 1,768 . Therefore, the length of segment upper G upper H is 1,768 millimeters, so the distance between points upper G and upper H is 1,768 millimeters. Choice A is incorrect.

    "rationale": "The correct answer is StartFraction 44 Over 3 EndFraction . It's given that in triangle upper R upper S upper T , angle upper T is a right angle. The area of a right triangle can be found using the formula upper A equals one half script l 1 script l 2 , where upper A represents the area of the right triangle, script l 1 represents the length of one leg of the triangle, and script l 2 represents the length of the other leg of the triangle. In triangle upper R upper S upper T , the two legs are line segment upper R upper T and line segment upper S upper T . Therefore, if the length of line segment upper R upper T is 72 and the area of triangle upper R upper S upper T is 792 , then 792 equals one half left parenthesis 72 right parenthesis left parenthesis upper S upper T right parenthesis , or 792 equals left parenthesis 36 right parenthesis left parenthesis upper S upper T right parenthesis . Dividing both sides of this equation by 36 yields 22 equals upper S upper T . Therefore, the length of line segment upper S upper T is 22 . It's also given that point upper L lies on line segment upper R upper S , point upper K lies on line segment upper S upper T , and line segment upper L upper K is parallel to line segment upper R upper T . It follows that angle upper L upper K upper S is a right angle. Since triangles upper R upper S upper T and upper L upper S upper K share angle upper S and have right angles upper T and upper K , respectively, triangles upper R upper S upper T and upper L upper S upper K are similar triangles. Therefore, the ratio of the length of line segment upper R upper T to the length of line segment upper L upper K is equal to the ratio of the length of line segment upper S upper T to the length of line segment upper S upper K . If the length of line segment upper R upper T is 72 and the length of line segment upper L upper K is 24 , it follows that the ratio of the length of line segment upper R upper T to the length of line segment upper L upper K is StartFraction 72 Over 24 EndFraction , or 3 , so the ratio of the length of line segment upper S upper T to the length of line segment upper S upper K is 3 . Therefore, StartFraction 22 Over upper S upper K EndFraction equals 3 . Multiplying both sides of this equation by upper S upper K yields 22 equals left parenthesis 3 right parenthesis left parenthesis upper S upper K right parenthesis . Dividing both sides of this equation by 3 yields StartFraction 22 Over 3 EndFraction equals upper S upper K . Since the length of line segment upper S upper T , 22 , is the sum of the length of line segment upper S upper K , StartFraction 22 Over 3 EndFraction , and the length of line segment upper K upper T , it follows that the length of line segment upper K upper T is 22 minus StartFraction 22 Over 3 EndFraction , or StartFraction 44 Over 3 EndFraction .

    "rationale": "Choice A is correct. The standard form for the equation of a circle is open parenthesis, x minus h, close parenthesis, squared, plus, open parenthesis, y minus k, close parenthesis, squared, equals r squared , where the ordered pair h comma k are the coordinates of the center and r is the length of the radius. According to the given equation, the center of the circle is the point with coordinates 6 comma negative 5 . Let x sub 1 comma y sub 1 represent the coordinates of point Q. Since point P 10 comma negative 5 and point Q x sub 1 comma y sub 1 are the endpoints of a diameter of the circle, the center with coordinates 6 comma negative 5 lies on the diameter, halfway between P and Q. Therefore, the following relationships hold: the fraction with numerator x sub 1, plus 10, and denominator 2, equals 6 and the fraction with numerator y sub 1, plus negative 5, and denominator 2, equals negative 5 . Solving the equations for x sub 1 and y sub 1 , respectively, yields x sub 1, equals 2 and y sub 1, equals negative 5 . Therefore, the coordinates of point Q are 2 comma negative 5 .Alternate approach: Since point P 10 comma negative 5 on the circle and the center of the circle 6 comma negative 5 have the same y-coordinate, it follows that the radius of the circle is 10 minus 6, equals 4 . In addition, the opposite end of the diameter P Q must have the same y-coordinate as P and be 4 units away from the center. Hence, the coordinates of point Q must be 2 comma negative 5 .Choices B and D are incorrect because the points given in these choices lie on a diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter P Q . If either of these points were point Q, then line segment P Q would not be the diameter of the circle. Choice C is incorrect because the point with coordinates 6 comma negative 5 is the center of the circle and does not lie on the circle.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is correct. Since Line Segment upper P upper R and Line Segment upper Q upper S are diameters of the circle shown, Line Segment upper O upper S , Line Segment upper O upper R , Line Segment upper O upper P , and Line Segment upper O upper Q are radii of the circle and are therefore congruent. Since angle upper S upper O upper P and angle upper R upper O upper Q are vertical angles, they are congruent. Therefore, arc upper P upper S and arc upper Q upper R are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Similarly, angle upper S upper O upper R and angle upper P upper O upper Q are vertical angles, so they are congruent. Therefore, arc upper S upper R and arc upper P upper Q are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Let x represent the length of arc upper S upper R . Since arc upper S upper R and arc upper P upper Q are congruent arcs, the length of arc upper P upper Q can also be represented by x . It’s given that the length of arc upper P upper S is twice the length of arc upper P upper Q . Therefore, the length of arc upper P upper S can be represented by the expression 2 x . Since arc upper P upper S and arc upper Q upper R are congruent arcs, the length of arc upper Q upper R can also be represented by 2 x . This gives the expression x plus x plus 2 x plus 2 x . Since it's given that the circumference is 144 pi , the expression x plus x plus 2 x plus 2 x is equal to 144 pi . Thus x plus x plus 2 x plus 2 x equals 144 pi , or 6 x equals 144 pi . Dividing both sides of this equation by 6 yields x equals 24 pi . Therefore, the length of arc upper Q upper R is 2 left parenthesis 24 pi right parenthesis , or 48 pi . Choice A is incorrect. This is the length of arc upper P upper Q , not arc upper Q upper R . Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

    "rationale": "The correct answer is 47 . It's given that the measure of angle upper B is 139 degrees. Therefore, the exterior angle formed by extending segment upper A upper B at point upper B has measure 180 minus 139 , or 41 , degrees. It's given that segment upper A upper B is parallel to segment upper D upper E . Extending segment upper B upper C at point upper C and extending segment upper D upper E at point upper D until the two segments intersect results in a transversal that intersects two parallel line segments. One of these intersection points is point upper B , and let the other intersection point be point upper X . Since segment upper A upper B is parallel to segment upper D upper E , alternate interior angles are congruent. Angle upper C upper X upper D and the exterior angle formed by extending segment upper A upper B at point upper B are alternate interior angles. Therefore, the measure of angle upper C upper X upper D is 41 degrees. It's given that the measure of angle upper D in pentagon upper A upper B upper C upper D upper E is 174 degrees. Therefore, angle upper C upper D upper X has measure 180 minus 174 , or 6 , degrees. Since angle upper C in pentagon upper A upper B upper C upper D upper E is an exterior angle of triangle upper C upper D upper X , it follows that the measure of angle upper C is the sum of the measures of angles upper C upper D upper X and upper C upper X upper D . Therefore, the measure, in degrees, of angle upper C is 6 plus 41 , or 47 . Alternate approach: A line can be created that's perpendicular to segments upper A upper B and upper D upper E and passes through point upper C . Extending segments upper A upper B and upper D upper E at points upper B and upper D , respectively, until they intersect this line yields two right triangles. Let these intersection points be point upper X and point upper Y , and the two right triangles be triangle upper B upper X upper C and triangle upper D upper Y upper C . It's given that the measure of angle upper B is 139 degrees. Therefore, angle upper C upper B upper X has measure 180 minus 139 , or 41 , degrees. Since the measure of angle upper C upper B upper X is 41 degrees and the measure of angle upper B upper X upper C is 90 degrees, it follows that the measure of angle upper X upper C upper B is 180 minus 90 minus 41 , or 49 , degrees. It's given that the measure of angle upper D is 174 degrees. Therefore, angle upper Y upper D upper C has measure 180 minus 174 , or 6 , degrees. Since the measure of angle upper Y upper D upper C is 6 degrees and the measure of angle upper C upper Y upper D is 90 degrees, it follows that the measure of angle upper D upper C upper Y is 180 minus 90 minus 6 , or 84 , degrees. Since angles upper X upper C upper B , upper D upper C upper Y , and angle upper C in pentagon upper A upper B upper C upper D upper E form segment upper X upper Y , it follows that the sum of the measures of those angles is 180 degrees. Therefore, the measure, in degrees, of angle upper C is 180 minus 49 minus 84 , or 47 .",

    "rationale": "The correct answer is StartFraction 21 Over 29 EndFraction . It's given that triangle upper A upper B upper C is similar to triangle upper D upper E upper F , where angle upper A corresponds to angle upper D and angles upper C and upper F are right angles. In similar triangles, the tangents of corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, if tangent upper A equals StartFraction 21 Over 20 EndFraction , then tangent upper D equals StartFraction 21 Over 20 EndFraction . In a right triangle, the tangent of an acute angle is the ratio of the length of the leg opposite the angle to the length of the leg adjacent to the angle. Therefore, in triangle upper D upper E upper F , if tangent upper D equals StartFraction 21 Over 20 EndFraction , the ratio of the length of line segment upper E upper F to the length of line segment upper D upper F is StartFraction 21 Over 20 EndFraction . If the lengths of line segment upper E upper F and line segment upper D upper F are 21 and 20 , respectively, then the ratio of the length of line segment upper E upper F to the length of line segment upper D upper F is StartFraction 21 Over 20 EndFraction . In a right triangle, the sine of an acute angle is the ratio of the length of the leg opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore, the value of sine upper D is the ratio of the length of line segment upper E upper F to the length of line segment upper D upper E . The length of line segment upper D upper E can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that if the lengths of the legs of a right triangle are a and b and the length of the hypotenuse is c , then a squared plus b squared equals c squared . Therefore, if the lengths of line segment upper E upper F and line segment upper D upper F are 21 and 20 , respectively, then left parenthesis 21 right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis 20 right parenthesis squared equals left parenthesis upper D upper E right parenthesis squared , or 841 equals left parenthesis upper D upper E right parenthesis squared . Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields 29 equals upper D upper E . Therefore, if the lengths of line segment upper E upper F and line segment upper D upper F are 21 and 20 , respectively, then the length of line segment upper D upper E is 29 and the ratio of the length of line segment upper E upper F to the length of line segment upper D upper E is StartFraction 21 Over 29 EndFraction . Thus, if tangent upper A equals StartFraction 21 Over 20 EndFraction , the value of sine upper D is StartFraction 21 Over 29 EndFraction .

Let x represent upper T upper S , the length of the other leg of the triangle shown. Therefore, 53 squared equals left parenthesis StartRoot 105 EndRoot right parenthesis squared plus x squared , or 2,809 equals 105 plus x squared . Subtracting 105 from both sides of this equation yields 2,704 equals x squared . Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields 52 equals x . Therefore, upper T upper S , the length of the other leg of the triangle shown, is 52 . The sine of an acute angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the leg opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. The length of the leg opposite angle upper R is 52 , and the length of the hypotenuse is 53 . Therefore, the value of sine upper R is StartFraction 52 Over 53 EndFraction .

It follows that angle upper A upper C upper B is congruent to angle upper A upper E upper D . It's also given that angle upper B upper A upper C and angle upper D upper A upper E are the same angle. It follows that angle upper B upper A upper C is congruent to angle upper D upper A upper E .

Substituting 3 for upper A upper C , 24 for upper A upper E , and StartRoot 34 EndRoot for upper A upper B in the equation StartFraction upper A upper D Over upper A upper B EndFraction equals StartFraction upper A upper E Over upper A upper C EndFraction yields StartFraction upper A upper D Over StartRoot 34 EndRoot EndFraction equals StartFraction 24 Over 3 EndFraction , or StartFraction upper A upper D Over StartRoot 34 EndRoot EndFraction equals 8 .

Since triangle upper A upper D upper E is a right triangle, it follows that upper A upper D represents the length of the hypotenuse, c , and upper D upper E and upper A upper E represent the lengths of the legs, a and b . Substituting 24 for b and 8 StartRoot 34 EndRoot for c in the equation a squared plus b squared equals c squared yields a squared plus left parenthesis 24 right parenthesis squared equals left parenthesis 8 StartRoot 34 EndRoot right parenthesis squared , which is equivalent to a squared plus 576 equals 64 left parenthesis 34 right parenthesis , or a squared plus 576 equals 2,176 .
