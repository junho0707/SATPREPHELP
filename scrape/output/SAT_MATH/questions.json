    "correct_answer": "403",
    "rationale": "The correct answer is 403 . For a linear equation in one variable to have infinitely many solutions, the coefficients of the variable must be equal on both sides of the equation and the constant terms must also be equal on both sides of the equation. The given equation can be rewritten as StartFraction 4 left parenthesis 3 x plus 7 right parenthesis Over 4 EndFraction minus StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction equals r left parenthesis x minus 8 right parenthesis , or 3 x plus 7 minus StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction equals r left parenthesis x minus 8 right parenthesis . Applying the distributive property to the right-hand side of this equation yields 3 x plus 7 minus StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction equals r x minus 8 r . For this equation to have infinitely many solutions, the coefficients of x must be equal, so it follows that 3 equals r . Additionally, the constant terms must be equal, which means 7 minus StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction equals minus 8 r . Substituting 3 for r in this equation yields 7 minus StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction equals minus 8 left parenthesis 3 right parenthesis , or 7 minus StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction equals negative 24 . Adding StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction to both sides of this equation yields 7 equals negative 24 plus StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction . Adding 24 to both sides of this equation yields 31 equals StartFraction s Over 13 EndFraction . Multiplying both sides of this equation by 13 yields 403 equals s . Therefore, if the equation has infinitely many solutions, the value of s is 403 .",

    "rationale": "Choice D is correct. A line in the xy-plane that passes through the points left parenthesis x 1 comma y 1 right parenthesis and left parenthesis x 2 comma y 2 right parenthesis has slope m , where m equals StartFraction y 2 minus y 1 Over x 2 minus x 1 EndFraction , and can be defined by an equation of the form y minus y 1 equals m left parenthesis x minus x 1 right parenthesis . One of the lines shown in the graph passes through the points left parenthesis 8 comma 0 right parenthesis and left parenthesis 3 comma 4 right parenthesis . Substituting 8 for x 1 , 0 for y 1 , 3 for x 2 , and 4 for y 2 in the equation m equals StartFraction y 2 minus y 1 Over x 2 minus x 1 EndFraction yields m equals StartFraction 4 minus 0 Over 3 minus 8 EndFraction , or m equals negative four fifths . Substituting negative four fifths for m , 8 for x 1 and 0 for y 1 in the equation y minus y 1 equals m left parenthesis x minus x 1 right parenthesis yields y minus 0 equals minus four fifths left parenthesis x minus 8 right parenthesis , which is equivalent to y equals minus four fifths x plus StartFraction 32 Over 5 EndFraction . Adding four fifths x to both sides of this equation yields four fifths x plus y equals StartFraction 32 Over 5 EndFraction . Multiplying both sides of this equation by negative 10 yields minus 8 x minus 10 y equals negative 64 . Therefore, an equation of this line is minus 8 x minus 10 y equals negative 64 . Similarly, the other line shown in the graph passes through the points left parenthesis 8 comma 0 right parenthesis and left parenthesis 3 comma 2 right parenthesis . Substituting 8 for x 1 , 0 for y 1 , 3 for x 2 , and 2 for y 2 in the equation m equals StartFraction y 2 minus y 1 Over x 2 minus x 1 EndFraction yields m equals StartFraction 2 minus 0 Over 3 minus 8 EndFraction , or m equals negative two fifths . Substituting negative two fifths for m , 8 for x 1 , and 0 for y 1 in the equation y minus y 1 equals m left parenthesis x minus x 1 right parenthesis yields y minus 0 equals minus two fifths left parenthesis x minus 8 right parenthesis , which is equivalent to y equals minus two fifths x plus StartFraction 16 Over 5 EndFraction . Adding two fifths x to both sides of this equation yields two fifths x plus y equals StartFraction 16 Over 5 EndFraction . Multiplying both sides of this equation by 10 yields 4 x plus 10 y equals 32 . Therefore, an equation of this line is 4 x plus 10 y equals 32 . So, the system of linear equations represented by the lines shown is 4 x plus 10 y equals 32 and minus 8 x minus 10 y equals negative 64 .
