A system of two linear equations in two variables, x and y , has zero points of intersection if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are distinct and parallel. The graphs of two lines in the xy-plane represented by equations in slope-intercept form, y equals m x plus b , are distinct if the y-coordinates of their y-intercepts, b , are different and are parallel if their slopes, m , are the same. For the two equations in the given system, y equals 2 x plus 10 and y equals 2 x minus 1 , the values of b are 10 and negative 1 , respectively, and the values of m are both 2 . Since the values of b are different, the graphs of these lines have different y-coordinates of the y-intercept and are distinct. Since the values of m are the same, the graphs of these lines have the same slope and are parallel. Therefore, the graphs of the given equations are lines that intersect at zero points in the xy-plane. Choice B is incorrect. The graphs of a system of two linear equations have exactly one point of intersection if the lines represented by the equations have different slopes. Since the given equations represent lines with the same slope, there is not exactly one intersection point. Choice C is incorrect. The graphs of a system of two linear equations can never have exactly two intersection points. Choice D is incorrect.

Two pairs of the selling price P and the demand Q are given. Using the coordinate pairs P comma Q , two points that satisfy the function are 40 comma 20,000 and 60 comma 15,000 . The slope m of the function can be found using the formula m equals, the fraction with numerator Q sub 2, minus Q sub 1, and denominator P sub 2, minus P sub 1, end fraction . Substituting the given values into this formula yields m equals, the fraction with numerator 15,000 minus 20,000, and denominator 60 minus 40, end fraction , or m equals, negative 250 . Therefore, Q equals, negative 250 P plus b . The value of b can be found by substituting one of the points into the function. Substituting the values of P and Q from the point with coordinates 40 comma 20,000 yields 20,000 equals, negative 250 times 40, plus b , or 20,000 equals, negative 10,000 plus b . Adding 10,000 to both sides of this equation yields b equals 30,000 . Therefore, the linear function the economist used as the model is Q equals, negative 250 P plus 30,000 . Substituting 55 for P yields Q equals, negative 250 times 55, plus 30,000, equals 16,250 . It follows that when the selling price is $55 per unit, the demand is 16,250 units.Choices B, C, and D are incorrect and may result from calculation or conceptual errors.",

A system of two linear equations in two variables, x and y , has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in standard form, upper A x plus upper B y equals upper C and upper D x plus upper E y equals upper F , are parallel if the coefficients for x and y in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation, meaning StartFraction upper D Over upper A EndFraction equals StartFraction upper E Over upper B EndFraction ; and the lines are distinct if the constants are not proportional, meaning StartFraction upper F Over upper C EndFraction is not equal to StartFraction upper D Over upper A EndFraction or StartFraction upper E Over upper B EndFraction . The given equation, y equals 6 x plus 18 , can be written in standard form by subtracting 6 x from both sides of the equation to yield minus 6 x plus y equals 18 . Therefore, the given equation can be written in the form upper A x plus upper B y equals upper C , where upper A equals negative 6 , upper B equals 1 , and upper C equals 18 . The equation in choice B, minus 6 x plus y equals 22 , is written in the form upper D x plus upper E y equals upper F , where upper D equals negative 6 , upper E equals 1 , and upper F equals 22 . Therefore, StartFraction upper D Over upper A EndFraction equals StartFraction negative 6 Over negative 6 EndFraction , which can be rewritten as StartFraction upper D Over upper A EndFraction equals 1 ; StartFraction upper E Over upper B EndFraction equals one oneth , which can be rewritten as StartFraction upper E Over upper B EndFraction equals 1 ; and StartFraction upper F Over upper C EndFraction equals StartFraction 22 Over 18 EndFraction , which can be rewritten as StartFraction upper F Over upper C EndFraction equals StartFraction 11 Over 9 EndFraction . Since StartFraction upper D Over upper A EndFraction equals 1 , StartFraction upper E Over upper B EndFraction equals 1 , and StartFraction upper F Over upper C EndFraction is not equal to 1 , it follows that the given equation and the equation minus 6 x plus y equals 22 are parallel and distinct.

Thus, the equation in choice B could be the second equation in the system. Choice A is incorrect. The equation minus 6 x plus y equals 18 and the given equation represent the same line in the xy-plane. Therefore, a system of these linear equations would have infinitely many solutions, rather than no solution. Choice C is incorrect.

Therefore, a system of these linear equations would have exactly one solution, rather than no solution. Choice D is incorrect. The equation minus 12 x plus y equals 18 and the given equation represent lines in the xy-plane that are distinct and not parallel.

It’s also given that the second customer paid 19.42 dollars for 4 loaves of bread and 1 dozen eggs. Therefore, the second customer’s purchase can be represented by the equation 4 l plus d equals 19.42 . The equations l plus 2 d equals 12.45 and 4 l plus d equals 19.42 form a system of linear equations, which can be solved by elimination to find the value of d .

    "question_text": "A group of 202 people went on an overnight camping trip, taking 60 tents with them. Some of the tents held 2 people each, and the rest held 4 people each. Assuming all the tents were filled to capacity and every person got to sleep in a tent, exactly how many of the tents were 2-person tents?",

      "30",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is correct. Let x represent the number of 2-person tents and let y represent the number of 4-person tents. It is given that the total number of tents was 60 and the total number of people in the group was 202. This situation can be expressed as a system of two equations, x plus y, equals 60 and 2 x plus 4 y, equals 202 . The first equation can be rewritten as y equals, negative x plus 60 . Substituting negative x plus 60 for y in the equation 2 x plus 4 y, equals 202 yields 2 x plus, 4 times, open parenthesis, negative x plus 60, close parenthesis, equals 202 . Distributing and combining like terms gives negative 2 x plus 240, equals 202 . Subtracting 240 from both sides of negative 2 x plus 240, equals 202 and then dividing both sides by negative 2 gives x equals 19 . Therefore, the number of 2-person tents is 19.Alternate approach: If each of the 60 tents held 4 people, the total number of people that could be accommodated in tents would be 240. However, the actual number of people who slept in tents was 202. The difference of 38 accounts for the 2-person tents. Since each of these tents holds 2 people fewer than a 4-person tent, thirty eight halves, equals 19 gives the number of 2-person tents.Choice A is incorrect. This choice may result from assuming exactly half of the tents hold 2 people. If that were true, then the total number of people who slept in tents would be 2 times 30, plus, 4 times 30, equals 180 ; however, the total number of people who slept in tents was 202, not 180. Choice B is incorrect. If 20 tents were 2-person tents, then the remaining 40 tents would be 4-person tents. Since all the tents were filled to capacity, the total number of people who slept in tents would be 2 times 20, plus, 4 times 40, equals, 40 plus 160, which equals 200 ; however, the total number of people who slept in tents was 202, not 200. Choice D is incorrect. If 18 tents were 2-person tents, then the remaining 42 tents would be 4-person tents. Since all the tents were filled to capacity, the total number of people who slept in tents would be 2 times 18, plus, 4 times 42, equals, 36 plus 168, which equals 204 ; however, the total number of people who slept in tents was 202, not 204.",

Given two points on a line, left parenthesis x 1 comma y 1 right parenthesis and left parenthesis x 2 comma y 2 right parenthesis , the slope of the line can be calculated using the equation m equals StartFraction y 2 minus y 1 Over x 2 minus x 1 EndFraction . Substituting left parenthesis 0 comma 6 right parenthesis and left parenthesis 2 comma 0 right parenthesis for left parenthesis x 1 comma y 1 right parenthesis and left parenthesis x 2 comma y 2 right parenthesis , respectively, in this equation yields m equals StartFraction 0 minus 6 Over 2 minus 0 EndFraction , which is equivalent to m equals negative six halves , or m equals negative 3 . Since left parenthesis 0 comma 6 right parenthesis is the y-intercept, it follows that b equals 6 . Substituting negative 3 for m and 6 for b in the equation y equals m x plus b yields y equals minus 3 x plus 6 . Adding 3 x to both sides of this equation yields 3 x plus y equals 6 . Multiplying this equation by 6 yields 18 x plus 6 y equals 36 . It follows that the equation 18 x plus upper R y equals 36 , where upper R is a positive constant, represents this relationship. Choice A is incorrect. The graph of this relationship passes through the point left parenthesis 0 comma 2 right parenthesis , not left parenthesis 0 comma 6 right parenthesis . Choice B is incorrect. The graph of this relationship passes through the point left parenthesis 0 comma 2 right parenthesis , not left parenthesis 0 comma 6 right parenthesis . Choice D is incorrect. The graph of this relationship passes through the point left parenthesis negative 2 comma 0 right parenthesis , not left parenthesis 2 comma 0 right parenthesis .",

Because f is a linear function of x, the equation f of x equals, m x plus b , where m and b are constants, can be used to define the relationship between x and f (x). In this equation, m represents the increase in the value of f (x) for every increase in the value of x by 1. From the table, it can be determined that the value of f (x) increases by 8 for every increase in the value of x by 2. In other words, for the function f the value of m is eight halves , or 4. The value of b can be found by substituting the values of x and f (x) from any row of the table and the value of m into the equation f of x equals, m x plus b and solving for b. For example, using x equals 1 , f of x equals 5 , and m equals 4 yields 5 equals, 4 times 1, plus b . Solving for b yields b equals 1 . Therefore, the equation defining the function f can be written in the form f of x equals, 4 x plus 1 .Choices A, B, and D are incorrect.

It gives the number of years after installation at which the total amount of energy cost savings will be less than the installation cost. Choice C is incorrect and may result from subtracting the average annual energy cost for the home from the onetime costof the geothermal heating system installation. To find the predicted total savings, the predicted average cost should be subtracted from the average annual energy cost before the installation, and the result should be multiplied by the number of years, t. Choice D is incorrect and may result from misunderstanding the context.

The price per adult ticket is $12, and the price per child ticket is $8. Since the theater received a total of $300 for the 30 tickets sold, it follows that 12a + 8c = 300. To eliminate c, the first equation can be multiplied by 8 and then subtracted from the second equation: 12 a, plus 8 c, equals 300, and negative 8 a, minus 8 c, equals negative 240, gives 4 a, plus 0 c, equals 60 Because the question asks for the amount spent on adult tickets, which is 12a dollars, the resulting equation can be multiplied by 3 to give 3(4a) = 3(60) = 180. Therefore, $180 was spent on adult tickets.Alternate approach: If all the 30 tickets sold were child tickets, their total price would be 30($8) = $240. Since the actual total price of the 30 tickets was $300, the extra $60 indicates that a certain number of adult tickets, a, were sold. Since the price of each adult ticket is $4 more than each child ticket, 4a = 60, and it follows that 12a = 180.",

    "rationale": "Choice D is correct. Since a 160-pound adult uses 200 calories for every 30 minutes of hiking, then the same adult uses 200 h calories after hiking for h 30-minute periods. Similarly, the same adult uses 150 b calories after bicycling for b 30-minute periods. Therefore, the equation 200 h plus 150 b, equals 1,900 represents the situation where a 160-pound adult uses a total of 1,900 calories from hiking for h 30-minute periods and bicycling for b 30-minute periods. It’s given that the adult completes 1 hour, or 2 30-minute periods, of bicycling. Substituting 2 for b in the equation 200 h plus 150 b, equals 1,900 yields 200 h plus, 150 times 2, equals 1,900 , or 200 h plus 300, equals 1,900 . Subtracting 300 from both sides of this equation yields 200 h equals 1,600 . Dividing both sides by 200 yields h equals 8 . Since h represents the number of 30-minute periods spent hiking and there are 2 30-minute periods in every hour, it follows that the adult will need to hike for the fraction eight over 2 , or 4 hours to use a total of 1,900 calories from bicycling and hiking.Choice A is incorrect and may result from solving the equation 200 h equals 1,900 .

    "answer_choices": [],
    "correct_answer": "8",
    "rationale": "The correct answer is 8 . The given system of equations can be solved using the elimination method. Multiplying both sides of the second equation in the given system by negative 2 yields minus 2 t y equals negative 1 minus 4 x , or negative 1 minus 4 x equals minus 2 t y . Adding this equation to the first equation in the given system, 4 x minus 6 y equals 10 y plus 2 , yields left parenthesis 4 x minus 6 y right parenthesis plus left parenthesis negative 1 minus 4 x right parenthesis equals left parenthesis 10 y plus 2 right parenthesis plus left parenthesis minus 2 t y right parenthesis , or negative 1 minus 6 y equals 10 y minus 2 t y plus 2 . Subtracting 10 y from both sides of this equation yields left parenthesis negative 1 minus 6 y right parenthesis minus left parenthesis 10 y right parenthesis equals left parenthesis 10 y minus 2 t y plus 2 right parenthesis minus left parenthesis 10 y right parenthesis , or negative 1 minus 16 y equals minus 2 t y plus 2 . If the given system has no solution, then the equation negative 1 minus 16 y equals minus 2 t y plus 2 has no solution. If this equation has no solution, the coefficients of y on each side of the equation, negative 16 and minus 2 t , must be equal, which yields the equation negative 16 equals minus 2 t . Dividing both sides of this equation by negative 2 yields 8 equals t . Thus, if the system has no solution, the value of t is 8 . Alternate approach: A system of two linear equations in two variables, x and y , has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in the form upper A x plus upper B y equals upper C , where upper A , upper B , and upper C are constant terms, are parallel if the ratio of the x-coefficients is equal to the ratio of the y-coefficients, and distinct if the ratio of the x-coefficients are not equal to the ratio of the constant terms. Subtracting 10 y from both sides of the first equation in the given system yields left parenthesis 4 x minus 6 y right parenthesis minus left parenthesis 10 y right parenthesis equals left parenthesis 10 y plus 2 right parenthesis minus left parenthesis 10 y right parenthesis , or 4 x minus 16 y equals 2 . Subtracting 2 x from both sides of the second equation in the given system yields left parenthesis t y right parenthesis minus left parenthesis 2 x right parenthesis equals left parenthesis one half plus 2 x right parenthesis minus left parenthesis 2 x right parenthesis , or minus 2 x plus t y equals one half . The ratio of the x-coefficients for these equations is negative two fourths , or negative one half . The ratio of the y-coefficients for these equations is minus StartFraction t Over 16 EndFraction . The ratio of the constant terms for these equations is StartFraction one half Over 2 EndFraction , or one fourth . Since the ratio of the x-coefficients, negative one half , is not equal to the ratio of the constants, one fourth , the lines represented by the equations are distinct. Setting the ratio of the x-coefficients equal to the ratio of the y-coefficients yields negative one half equals minus StartFraction t Over 16 EndFraction . Multiplying both sides of this equation by negative 16 yields left parenthesis negative one half right parenthesis left parenthesis negative 16 right parenthesis equals left parenthesis minus StartFraction t Over 16 EndFraction right parenthesis left parenthesis negative 16 right parenthesis , or t equals 8 . Therefore, when t equals 8 , the lines represented by these equations are parallel. Thus, if the system has no solution, the value of t is 8 .",

It follows that if a new graph of three linear equations is created using the system of equations shown and the graph of x plus 4 y equals negative 16 , this system has either zero solutions or one solution, the point left parenthesis 8 comma 2 right parenthesis . Substituting 8 for x and 2 for y in the equation x plus 4 y equals negative 16 yields 8 plus 4 left parenthesis 2 right parenthesis equals negative 16 , or 16 equals negative 16 . Since this equation is not true, the point left parenthesis 8 comma 2 right parenthesis does not lie on the graph of x plus 4 y equals negative 16 . Therefore, left parenthesis 8 comma 2 right parenthesis is not a solution to the system of three equations. It follows that there are zero solutions to this system.

It's given that the sample has a total mass of 50.0 grams. Therefore, the equation x plus y equals 50.0 represents this situation. It's also given that the sample is 50.0 percent sign silicon by mass. Therefore, the total mass of the silicon in the sample is 0.500 left parenthesis 50.0 right parenthesis , or 25.0 , grams. It's also given that the first piece was 30.0 percent sign silicon by mass and the second piece was 80.0 percent sign silicon by mass. Therefore, the masses, in grams, of the silicon in the first and second pieces can be represented by the expressions 0.300 x and 0.800 y , respectively. Since the sample was created by combining the first and second pieces, and the total mass of the silicon in the sample is 25.0 grams, the equation 0.300 x plus 0.800 y equals 25.0 represents this situation. Subtracting y from both sides of the equation x plus y equals 50.0 yields x equals 50.0 minus y . Substituting 50.0 minus y for x in the equation 0.300 x plus 0.800 y equals 25.0 yields 0.300 left parenthesis 50.0 minus y right parenthesis plus 0.800 y equals 25.0 .

Therefore, the owner pays 4.90 s dollars for s small candles and 11.60 script l dollars for script l large candles, which means the owner pays a total of 4.90 s plus 11.60 script l dollars to purchase candles. It’s given that the owner budgets dollar sign 2,200 to purchase candles. Therefore, 4.90 s plus 11.60 script l less than or equals 2,200 . It’s also given that the owner must purchase a minimum of 200 candles. Therefore, s plus script l greater than or equals 200 . The inequalities 4.90 s plus 11.60 script l less than or equals 2,200 and s plus script l greater than or equals 200 can be combined into one compound inequality by rewriting the second inequality so that its left-hand side is equivalent to the left-hand side of the first inequality. Subtracting script l from both sides of the inequality s plus script l greater than or equals 200 yields s greater than or equals 200 minus script l .

It follows that 980 plus 6.70 script l less than or equals 2,200 . Subtracting 980 from both sides of this inequality yields 6.70 script l less than or equals 2,200 . Dividing both sides of this inequality by 6.70 yields approximately script l less than or equals 182.09 .

    "rationale": "Choice A is correct. It’s given that the window repair specialist charges dollar sign 220 for the first two hours of repair plus an hourly fee for each additional hour. Let n represent the hourly fee for each additional hour after the first two hours. Since it’s given that x is the number of hours of repair, it follows that the charge generated by the hourly fee after the first two hours can be represented by the expression n left parenthesis x minus 2 right parenthesis . Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair is f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 220 plus n left parenthesis x minus 2 right parenthesis . It’s given that the total cost for 5 hours of repair is dollar sign 400 . Substituting 5 for x and 400 for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis into the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 220 plus n left parenthesis x minus 2 right parenthesis yields 400 equals 220 plus n left parenthesis 5 minus 2 right parenthesis , or 400 equals 220 plus 3 n . Subtracting 220 from both sides of this equation yields 180 equals 3 n . Dividing both sides of this equation by 3 yields n equals 60 . Substituting 60 for n in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 220 plus n left parenthesis x minus 2 right parenthesis yields f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 220 plus 60 left parenthesis x minus 2 right parenthesis , which is equivalent to f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 220 plus 60 x minus 120 , or f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 60 x plus 100 . Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair is f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 60 x plus 100 . Choice B is incorrect. This function represents the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair where the specialist charges dollar sign 340 , rather than dollar sign 220 , for the first two hours of repair.

According to Moore’s law, every 2 years, the number of transistors included on microprocessors is estimated to double. Therefore, x years after 1985, the number of transistors will double x over 2 times. Since the number of transistors included on a microprocessor was 275,000, or .275 million, in 1985, the estimated number of transistors, in millions, included x years after 1985 can be modeled as 0 point 2 7 5 times 2 raised to the x over 2 power . The year in which the number of transistors is estimated to be 1.1 million is represented by the value of x when 1 point 1 equals, 0 point 2 7 5, times 2 raised to the x over 2 power . Dividing both sides of this equation by .275 yields 4 equals, 2 raised to the x over 2 power , which can be rewritten as 2 squared equals, 2 raised to the x over 2 power . Since the exponential equation has equal bases on each side, it follows that the exponents must also be equal: 2 equals x over 2 .

Multiplying the width, x inches, by the length, 7 x minus 4 inches, yields x left parenthesis 7 x minus 4 right parenthesis square inches.

If f left parenthesis negative 9 right parenthesis equals f left parenthesis 3 right parenthesis , then for the graph of y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis , the point with an x-coordinate of negative 9 and the point with an x-coordinate of 3 have the same y-coordinate. In the xy-plane, a parabola is a symmetric graph such that when two points have the same y-coordinate, these points are equidistant from the vertex, and the x-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the x-coordinates of these two points. Therefore, for the graph of y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis , the points with x-coordinates negative 9 and 3 are equidistant from the vertex, left parenthesis h comma k right parenthesis , and h is halfway between negative 9 and 3 .

The model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of 7 meters above the ground and reached a maximum height of 51.1 meters above the ground 3 seconds after the launch. How many seconds after the launch does the model estimate that the projectile will return to a height of 7 meters?",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is correct. It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It follows that an equation representing the model can be written in the form f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k , where f left parenthesis x right parenthesis is the projectile's estimated height above the ground, in meters, x seconds after the launch, a is a constant, and k is the maximum height above the ground, in meters, the model estimates the projectile reached h seconds after the launch. It's given that the model estimates the projectile reached a maximum height of 51.1 meters above the ground 3 seconds after the launch. Therefore, k equals 51.1 and h equals 3 . Substituting 51.1 for k and 3 for h in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k yields f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 . It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of 7 meters above the ground. Therefore, when x equals 0 , f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 7 . Substituting 0 for x and 7 for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 yields 7 equals a left parenthesis 0 minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 , or 7 equals 9 a plus 51.1 . Subtracting 51.1 from both sides of this equation yields negative 44.1 equals 9 a . Dividing both sides of this equation by 9 yields negative 4.9 equals a . Substituting negative 4.9 for a in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 yields f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals minus 4.9 left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 . Therefore, the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals minus 4.9 left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground x seconds after it was launched. The number of seconds after the launch that the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of 7 meters is the value of x when f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 7 . Substituting 7 for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals minus 4.9 left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 yields 7 equals minus 4.9 left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared plus 51.1 . Subtracting 51.1 from both sides of this equation yields negative 44.1 equals minus 4.9 left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared . Dividing both sides of this equation by negative 4.9 yields 9 equals left parenthesis x minus 3 right parenthesis squared . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields two equations: 3 equals x minus 3 and negative 3 equals x minus 3 . Adding 3 to both sides of the equation 3 equals x minus 3 yields 6 equals x . Adding 3 to both sides of the equation negative 3 equals x minus 3 yields 0 equals x . Since 0 seconds after the launch represents the time at which the projectile was launched, 6 must be the number of seconds the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of 7 meters. Alternate approach: It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of 7 meters above the ground and reached a maximum height of 51.1 meters above the ground 3 seconds after the launch. Since the model is quadratic, and quadratic functions are symmetric, the model estimates that for any given height less than the maximum height, the time the projectile takes to travel from the given height to the maximum height is the same as the time the projectile takes to travel from the maximum height back to the given height. Thus, since the model estimates the projectile took 3 seconds to travel from 7 meters above the ground to its maximum height of 51.1 meters above the ground, the model also estimates the projectile will take 3 more seconds to travel from its maximum height of 51.1 meters above the ground back to 7 meters above the ground. Thus, the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of 7 meters 3 seconds after it reaches its maximum height, which is 6 seconds after the launch. Choice A is incorrect. The model estimates that 3 seconds after the launch, the projectile reached a height of 51.1 meters, not 7 meters. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.",

Which of the following equations best represents this model, where upper C is the estimated number of comments on the article t hours after the article was first featured on the home page and t less than or equals 4 ?",

    "rationale": "Choice D is correct. It's given that an exponential model estimates that the number of comments on an article increased by a fixed percentage at the end of each hour. Therefore, the model can be represented by an exponential equation of the form upper C equals upper K a Superscript t , where upper C is the estimated number of comments on the article t hours after the article was first featured on the home page and upper K and a are constants. It's also given that when the article was first featured on the home page of the news website, there were 40 comments on the article. This means that when t equals 0 , upper C equals 40 . Substituting 0 for t and 40 for upper C in the equation upper C equals upper K a Superscript t yields 40 equals upper K a Superscript 0 , or 40 equals upper K . It's also given that the number of comments on the article at the end of an hour had increased by 190 percent sign of the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour. Multiplying the percent increase by the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour yields the number of estimated additional comments the article has on its home page: left parenthesis 40 right parenthesis left parenthesis StartFraction 190 Over 100 EndFraction right parenthesis , or 76 comments. Thus, the estimated number of comments for the following hour is the sum of the comments from the end of the previous hour and the number of additional comments, which is 40 plus 76 , or 116 . This means that when t equals 1 , upper C equals 116 . Substituting 1 for t , 116 for upper C , and 40 for upper K in the equation upper C equals upper K a Superscript t yields 116 equals 40 a Superscript 1 , or 116 equals 40 a . Dividing both sides of this equation by 40 yields 2.9 equals a . Substituting 40 for upper K and 2.9 for a in the equation upper C equals upper K a Superscript t yields upper C equals 40 left parenthesis 2.9 right parenthesis Superscript t . Thus, the equation that best represents this model is upper C equals 40 left parenthesis 2.9 right parenthesis Superscript t . Choice A is incorrect.

Choice B is incorrect. This model represents a situation where the number of comments at the end of each hour increased by 90 percent sign of the number of comments at the end of the previous hour, rather than 190 percent sign . Choice C is incorrect. This model represents a situation where the number of comments at the end of each hour was 19 times the number of comments at the end of the previous hour, rather than increasing by 190 percent sign of the number of comments at the end of the previous hour.",

Since the graph of y equals g left parenthesis x right parenthesis passes through the point left parenthesis 24 comma 0 right parenthesis , it follows that g left parenthesis 24 right parenthesis equals 0 , so t equals 24 . Substituting 24 for t in the equation g left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals left parenthesis x plus 14 right parenthesis left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis yields g left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals left parenthesis x plus 14 right parenthesis left parenthesis 24 minus x right parenthesis . The value of g left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis can be calculated by substituting 0 for x in this equation, which yields g left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals left parenthesis 0 plus 14 right parenthesis left parenthesis 24 minus 0 right parenthesis , or g left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals 336 .",

    "correct_answer": "-2112",
    "rationale": "The correct answer is negative 2,112 . It's given that f is a quadratic function. It follows that f can be defined by an equation of the form f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k , where a , h , and k are constants. It's also given that the table shows three values of x and their corresponding values of y , where y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis plus 4 . Substituting a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in this equation yields y equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k plus 4 . This equation represents a quadratic relationship between x and y , where k plus 4 is either the maximum or the minimum value of y , which occurs when x equals h . For quadratic relationships between x and y , the maximum or minimum value of y occurs at the value of x halfway between any two values of x that have the same corresponding value of y . The table shows that x-values of 21 and 25 correspond to the same y-value, negative 8 . Since 23 is halfway between 21 and 25 , the maximum or minimum value of y occurs at an x-value of 23 . The table shows that when x equals 23 , y equals 8 . It follows that h equals 23 and k plus 4 equals 8 . Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation k plus 4 equals 8 yields k equals 4 . Substituting 23 for h and 4 for k in the equation y equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k plus 4 yields y equals a left parenthesis x minus 23 right parenthesis squared plus 4 plus 4 , or y equals a left parenthesis x minus 23 right parenthesis squared plus 8 . The value of a can be found by substituting any x-value and its corresponding y-value for x and y , respectively, in this equation. Substituting 25 for x and negative 8 for y in this equation yields negative 8 equals a left parenthesis 25 minus 23 right parenthesis squared plus 8 , or negative 8 equals a left parenthesis 2 right parenthesis squared plus 8 . Subtracting 8 from both sides of this equation yields negative 16 equals a left parenthesis 2 right parenthesis squared , or negative 16 equals 4 a . Dividing both sides of this equation by 4 yields negative 4 equals a . Substituting negative 4 for a , 23 for h , and 4 for k in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k yields f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals minus 4 left parenthesis x minus 23 right parenthesis squared plus 4 . The y-intercept of the graph of y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the xy-plane is the point on the graph where x equals 0 . Substituting 0 for x in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals minus 4 left parenthesis x minus 23 right parenthesis squared plus 4 yields f left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals minus 4 left parenthesis 0 minus 23 right parenthesis squared plus 4 , or f left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals minus 4 left parenthesis negative 23 right parenthesis squared plus 4 . This is equivalent to f left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals negative 2,112 , so the y-intercept of the graph of y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the xy-plane is left parenthesis 0 comma negative 2,112 right parenthesis . Thus, the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph of y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the xy-plane is negative 2,112 .",

    "answer_choices": [],
    "correct_answer": "231",
    "rationale": "The correct answer is 231 . It's given that StartRoot k minus x EndRoot equals 58 minus x . Squaring both sides of this equation yields k minus x equals left parenthesis 58 minus x right parenthesis squared , which is equivalent to the given equation if 58 minus x greater than 0 . It follows that if a solution to the equation k minus x equals left parenthesis 58 minus x right parenthesis squared satisfies 58 minus x greater than 0 , then it's also a solution to the given equation; if not, it's extraneous. The equation k minus x equals left parenthesis 58 minus x right parenthesis squared can be rewritten as k minus x equals 3,364 minus 116 x plus x squared . Adding x to both sides of this equation yields k equals x squared minus 115 x plus 3,364 . Subtracting k from both sides of this equation yields 0 equals x squared minus 115 x plus left parenthesis 3,364 minus k right parenthesis . The number of solutions to a quadratic equation in the form 0 equals a x squared plus b x plus c , where a , b , and c are constants, can be determined by the value of the discriminant, b squared minus 4 a c . Substituting negative 115 for b , 1 for a , and 3,364 minus k for c in b squared minus 4 a c yields left parenthesis negative 115 right parenthesis squared minus 4 left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis left parenthesis 3,364 minus k right parenthesis , or 4 k minus 231 . The equation 0 equals x squared minus 115 x plus left parenthesis 3,364 minus k right parenthesis has exactly one real solution if the discriminant is equal to zero, or 4 k minus 231 equals 0 . Subtracting 231 from both sides of this equation yields 4 k equals 231 . Dividing both sides of this equation by 4 yields k equals 57.75 . Therefore, if k equals 57.75 , then the equation 0 equals x squared minus 115 x plus left parenthesis 3,364 minus k right parenthesis has exactly one real solution. Substituting 57.75 for k in this equation yields 0 equals x squared minus 115 x plus left parenthesis 3,364 minus 57.75 right parenthesis , or 0 equals x squared minus 115 x plus 3,306.25 , which is equivalent to 0 equals left parenthesis x minus 57.5 right parenthesis squared . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields 0 equals x minus 57.5 . Adding 57.5 to both sides of this equation yields 57.5 equals x . To check whether this solution satisfies 58 minus x greater than 0 , the solution, 57.5 , can be substituted for x in 58 minus x greater than 0 , which yields 58 minus 57.5 greater than 0 , or 0.5 greater than 0 . Since 0.5 is greater than 0 , it follows that if k equals 57.75 , or 4 k equals 231 , then the given equation has exactly one real solution. If 4 k less than 231 , then the discriminant, 4 k minus 231 , is negative and the given equation has no solutions. Therefore, the minimum possible value of 4 k is 231 .",

For an equation in the form f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a x squared plus b x plus c , where a , b , and c are constants, the x-coordinate of the vertex is minus StartFraction b Over 2 a EndFraction . For the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals x squared plus 3 x minus 130 , a equals 1 , b equals 3 , and c equals negative 130 . It follows that the x-coordinate of the vertex is minus StartFraction 3 Over 2 left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis EndFraction , or negative three halves . Therefore, f left parenthesis x right parenthesis reaches its minimum when the value of x is negative three halves . Alternate approach: The value of x for the vertex of a parabola is the x-value of the midpoint between the two x-intercepts of the parabola. Since it’s given that f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals left parenthesis x minus 10 right parenthesis left parenthesis x plus 13 right parenthesis , it follows that the two x-intercepts of the graph of y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the xy-plane occur when x equals 10 and x equals negative 13 , or at the points left parenthesis 10 comma 0 right parenthesis and left parenthesis negative 13 comma 0 right parenthesis . The midpoint between two points, left parenthesis x 1 comma y 1 right parenthesis and left parenthesis x 2 comma y 2 right parenthesis , is left parenthesis StartFraction x 1 plus x 2 Over 2 EndFraction comma StartFraction y 1 plus y 2 Over 2 EndFraction right parenthesis . Therefore, the midpoint between left parenthesis 10 comma 0 right parenthesis and left parenthesis negative 13 comma 0 right parenthesis is left parenthesis StartFraction 10 plus left parenthesis negative 13 right parenthesis Over 2 EndFraction comma StartFraction 0 plus 0 Over 2 EndFraction right parenthesis , or left parenthesis negative three halves comma 0 right parenthesis . It follows that f left parenthesis x right parenthesis reaches its minimum when the value of x is negative three halves . Choice A is incorrect. This is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph of y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the xy-plane. Choice B is incorrect. This is one of the x-coordinates of the x-intercepts of the graph of y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the xy-plane.

This relationship can be represented by the equation f of x equals, a, raised to the 4 x plus b power , where b is a constant. It’s given that when x equals 2 , f of x equals, a, to the fifth power . Substituting 2 for x and a, to the fifth power for f of x into f of x equals, a, raised to the 4 x plus b power yields a, to the fifth power equals, a, raised to the 4 times 2, plus b power . Since 4 times 2, plus b, equals 5 , it follows that b equals negative 3 . Thus, an equation that defines the function f is f of x equals, a, raised to the 4 x minus 3 power .

    "rationale": "Choice A is correct. Since it's given that the account balance, upper A left parenthesis t right parenthesis , in dollars, after t years can be modeled by an exponential function, it follows that function upper A can be written in the form upper A left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals upper N r Superscript t , where upper N is the initial value of the function and r is a constant related to the growth of the function. It's given that the initial balance of the account is dollar sign 36,100.00 , so it follows that the initial value of the function, or upper N , must be 36,100.00 . Substituting 36,100.00 for upper N in the equation upper A left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals upper N r Superscript t yields upper A left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals 36,100.00 r Superscript t . It's given that the account balance after 13 years, or when t equals 13 , is dollar sign 68,071.93 . It follows that upper A left parenthesis 13 right parenthesis equals 68,071.93 , or 36,100.00 r Superscript 13 Baseline equals 68,071.93 . Dividing each side of the equation 36,100.00 r Superscript 13 Baseline equals 68,071.93 by 36,100.00 yields r Superscript 13 Baseline equals StartFraction 68,071.93 Over 36,100.00 EndFraction . Taking the 13 th root of both sides of this equation yields r equals RootIndex 13 StartRoot StartFraction 68,071.93 Over 36,100.00 EndFraction EndRoot , or r is approximately equal to 1.05 . Substituting 1.05 for r in the equation upper A left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals 36,100.00 r Superscript t yields upper A left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals 36,100.00 left parenthesis 1.05 right parenthesis Superscript t , so the equation upper A left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals 36,100.00 left parenthesis 1.05 right parenthesis Superscript t could define upper A . Choice B is incorrect. Substituting 0 for t in this function indicates an initial balance of dollar sign 31,971.93 , rather than dollar sign 36,100.00 . Choice C is incorrect. Substituting 0 for t in this function indicates an initial balance of dollar sign 31,971.93 , rather than dollar sign 36,100.00 . Additionally, this function indicates the account balance is decreasing, rather than increasing, over time. Choice D is incorrect.

Substituting negative 1 for x and 10 for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k gives 10 equals a left parenthesis negative 1 minus h right parenthesis squared plus k , which is equivalent to 10 equals a left parenthesis 1 plus 2 h plus h squared right parenthesis plus k , or 10 equals a plus 2 a h plus a h squared plus k . It’s given in the table that when x equals 0 , the corresponding value of f left parenthesis x right parenthesis is 14 . Substituting 0 for x and 14 for f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k gives 14 equals a left parenthesis 0 minus h right parenthesis squared plus k , or 14 equals a h squared plus k .

Adding 20 equals a minus 2 a h plus a h squared plus k to the equation 10 equals a plus 2 a h plus a h squared plus k gives 30 equals 2 a plus 2 a h squared plus 2 k . Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 gives 15 equals a plus a h squared plus k . Since 14 equals a h squared plus k , substituting 14 for a h squared plus k into the equation 15 equals a plus a h squared plus k gives 15 equals a plus 14 . Subtracting 14 from both sides of this equation gives a equals 1 . Substituting 1 for a in the equations 14 equals a h squared plus k and 20 equals a h squared minus 2 a h plus a plus k gives 14 equals h squared plus k and 20 equals 1 minus 2 h plus h squared plus k , respectively. Since 14 equals h squared plus k , substituting 14 for h squared plus k in the equation 20 equals 1 minus 2 h plus h squared plus k gives 20 equals 1 minus 2 h plus 14 , or 20 equals 15 minus 2 h . Subtracting 15 from both sides of this equation gives 5 equals minus 2 h . Dividing both sides of this equation by negative 2 gives negative five halves equals h .

Subtracting StartFraction 25 Over 4 EndFraction from both sides of this equation gives StartFraction 31 Over 4 EndFraction equals k . Substituting 1 for a , negative five halves for h , and StartFraction 31 Over 4 EndFraction for k in the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a left parenthesis x minus h right parenthesis squared plus k gives f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals left parenthesis x plus five halves right parenthesis squared plus StartFraction 31 Over 4 EndFraction , which is equivalent to f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals x squared plus 5 x plus StartFraction 25 Over 4 EndFraction plus StartFraction 31 Over 4 EndFraction , or f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals x squared plus 5 x plus 14 .

It's given that f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals left parenthesis x minus 14 right parenthesis left parenthesis x plus 19 right parenthesis , which can be rewritten as f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals x squared plus 5 x minus 266 . Since the coefficient of the x squared -term is positive, the graph of y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the xy-plane opens upward and reaches its minimum value at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is the value of x such that f left parenthesis x right parenthesis reaches its minimum. For an equation in the form f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals a x squared plus b x plus c , where a , b , and c are constants, the x-coordinate of the vertex is minus StartFraction b Over 2 a EndFraction . For the equation f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals x squared plus 5 x minus 266 , a equals 1 , b equals 5 , and c equals negative 266 . It follows that the x-coordinate of the vertex is minus StartFraction 5 Over 2 left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis EndFraction , or negative five halves . Therefore, f left parenthesis x right parenthesis reaches its minimum when the value of x is negative five halves . Alternate approach: The value of x for the vertex of a parabola is the x-value of the midpoint between the two x-intercepts of the parabola. Since it’s given that f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals left parenthesis x minus 14 right parenthesis left parenthesis x plus 19 right parenthesis , it follows that the two x-intercepts of the graph of y equals f left parenthesis x right parenthesis in the xy-plane occur when x equals 14 and x equals negative 19 , or at the points left parenthesis 14 comma 0 right parenthesis and left parenthesis negative 19 comma 0 right parenthesis .

Therefore, the function f can be defined by f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 86 left parenthesis 0 period 2 right parenthesis Superscript x . Substituting 2 for x in this function yields f left parenthesis 2 right parenthesis equals 86 left parenthesis 0 period 2 right parenthesis squared , which is equivalent to f left parenthesis 2 right parenthesis equals 86 left parenthesis 0 period 04 right parenthesis , or f left parenthesis 2 right parenthesis equals 3 period 44 . Either 3.44 or 86 divided by 25 may be entered as the correct answer. Alternate approach: It’s given that f left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals 86 and that for each increase in x by 1 , the value of f left parenthesis x right parenthesis decreases by 80 percent sign . Therefore, when x equals 1 , the value of f left parenthesis x right parenthesis is left parenthesis 100 minus 80 right parenthesis percent sign , or 20 percent sign , of 86 , which can be expressed as left parenthesis 0 period 20 right parenthesis left parenthesis 86 right parenthesis . Since left parenthesis 0 period 20 right parenthesis left parenthesis 86 right parenthesis equals 17 period 2 , the value of f left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis is 17.2 . Similarly, when x equals 2 , the value of f left parenthesis x right parenthesis is 20 percent sign of 17.2 , which can be expressed as left parenthesis 0 period 20 right parenthesis left parenthesis 17 period 2 right parenthesis . Since left parenthesis 0 period 20 right parenthesis left parenthesis 17 period 2 right parenthesis equals 3 period 44 , the value of f left parenthesis 2 right parenthesis is 3.44 . Either 3.44 or 86 divided by 25 may be entered as the correct answer.",

The increase in Iceland’s population can be found by multiplying the increase in population density, in people per square kilometer, by the area, in square kilometers. It’s given that the population density of Iceland was 2.5 people per square kilometer in 1990 and 3.3 people per square kilometer in 2014. The increase in population density can be found by subtracting 2.5 from 3.3, which yields 0.8. It’s given that the land area of Iceland was 100,250 square kilometers. Thus, the increase in population is 0 point 8 times 100,250 , or 80,200.Alternate approach: It’s given that the population density of Iceland, in people per square kilometer of land area, in 1990 was 2.5. Since the land area of Iceland was 100,250 square kilometers, it follows that the population of Iceland in 1990 was 2 point 5 times 100,250 , or 250,625. Similarly, the population of Iceland in 2014 was 3 point 3 times 100,250 , or 330,825.

In class B, the maximum number of books read is 10 and the minimum number of books read is 1 . The difference between those values is 10 minus 1 , or 9 . Therefore, the range of the number of books read in class B is 9 . To find the positive difference between the ranges of the number of books read for the two classes, the smaller range must be subtracted from the larger range. Therefore, the positive difference between the ranges of number of books read over the summer for the two classes is 9 minus 5 , or 4 .",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is correct. It’s given that the ratio of the rectangular region’s length to its width is 35 to 10 . This can be written as a proportion: StartFraction length Over width EndFraction equals StartFraction 35 Over 10 EndFraction , or StartFraction script l Over w EndFraction equals StartFraction 35 Over 10 EndFraction . This proportion can be rewritten as 10 script l equals 35 w , or script l equals 3.5 w . If the width of the rectangular region increases by 7 , then the length will increase by some number x in order to maintain this ratio. The value of x can be found by replacing script l with script l plus x and w with w plus 7 in the equation, which gives script l plus x equals 3.5 left parenthesis w plus 7 right parenthesis . This equation can be rewritten using the distributive property as script l plus x equals 3.5 w plus 24.5 . Since script l equals 3.5 w , the right-hand side of this equation can be rewritten by substituting script l for 3.5 w , which gives script l plus x equals script l plus 24.5 , or x equals 24.5 . Therefore, if the width of the rectangular region increases by 7 units, the length must increase by 24.5 units in order to maintain the given ratio. Choice A is incorrect. If the width of the rectangular region increases, the length must also increase, not decrease. Choice C is incorrect. If the width of the rectangular region increases, the length must also increase, not decrease. Choice D is incorrect. Since the ratio of the length to the width of the rectangular region is 35 to 10 , if the width of the rectangular region increases by 7 units, the length would have to increase by a proportional amount, which would have to be greater than 7 units.",

For any batch of paint that uses the same ratio, the amount of yellow paint used will be three halves , or 1.5, times the amount of blue paint used in the batch. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint Anita will use in the second batch will be 1.5 times the amount of blue paint used in the second batch.Alternate approach: It’s given that Anita used a ratio of 2 ounces of blue paint to 3 ounces of yellow paint for the first batch and that she will use 5 ounces of blue paint for the second batch. A proportion can be set up to solve for x, the amount of yellow paint she will use for the second batch: 2 over 3, equals, 5 over x . Multiplying both sides of this equation by 3 yields 2 equals, 15 over x , and multiplying both sides of this equation by x yields 2 x equals 15 . Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields x equals 7 point 5 . Since Anita will use 7.5 ounces of yellow paint for the second batch, this is 7 point 5 over 5 equals 1 point 5 times the amount of blue paint (5 ounces) used in the second batch.Choices A, B, and C are incorrect and may result from incorrectly interpreting the ratio of blue paint to yellow paint used.",

In the figure shown, the angle measuring y degree is congruent to its vertical angle formed by lines s and m , so the measure of the vertical angle is also y degree . The vertical angle forms a same-side interior angle pair with the angle measuring x degree . It's given that lines r and s are parallel. Therefore, same-side interior angles in the figure are supplementary, which means the sum of the measure of the vertical angle and the measure of the angle measuring x degree is 180 degree , or x plus y equals 180 .

Extending segment upper B upper C at point upper C and extending segment upper D upper E at point upper D until the two segments intersect results in a transversal that intersects two parallel line segments. One of these intersection points is point upper B , and let the other intersection point be point upper X . Since segment upper A upper B is parallel to segment upper D upper E , alternate interior angles are congruent.
