    "prompt_text": "Marta Coll and colleagues’ 2010 Mediterranean Sea biodiversity census reported approximately 17,000 species, nearly double the number reported in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri’s 2000 census—a difference only partly attributable to the description of new invertebrate species in the interim. Another factor is that the morphological variability of microorganisms is poorly understood compared to that of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and algae, creating uncertainty about how to evaluate microorganisms as species. Researchers’ decisions on such matters therefore can be highly consequential. Indeed, the two censuses reported similar counts of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, suggesting that ______\nblank",

      "Coll and colleagues reported a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did largely due to the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s census.",
      "some differences observed in microorganisms may have been treated as variations within species by Bianchi and Morri but treated as indicative of distinct species by Coll and colleagues.",
      "Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to the degree of morphological variation displayed within a typical species of microorganism than Coll and colleagues were.",
      "the absence of clarity regarding how to differentiate among species of microorganisms may have resulted in Coll and colleagues underestimating the number of microorganism species."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’s discussion of the different counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can only be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means there must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’s count. The text goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms’ morphological variability, or the differences in microorganisms’ structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify microorganisms by species and means that researchers’ decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect on the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar numbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from differences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated some of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas Bianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many more species than Bianchi and Morri did.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate species in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues’ count and Bianchi and Morri’s count that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’s study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been less sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues were. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and Morri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation would lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as variations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report fewer overall species. Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported many more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and colleagues would not explain that difference—it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should have been even larger.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of perceptions of digital versus physical gift cards. The text begins by explaining that the perception of \"the time spent obtaining a gift…as a reflection of the gift’s thoughtfulness\" is a social norm of gift giving. The text then explains that although those who receive digital gift cards view them as easier to use than physical gift cards, a marketing study nonetheless showed that 94.8% of participants found physical gift cards more \"socially acceptable\" to give. The text specifically contrasts the ease with which digital gift cards \"can be purchased online from anywhere\" with the fact that physical gift cards \"sometimes must be purchased in person\"—suggesting the greater difficulty of obtaining physical cards. Given the text’s initial premise that gift-giving norms equate the thoughtfulness of a gift with the effort involved in acquiring that gift, it is reasonable to infer that people perceive digital gift cards as requiring less effort to obtain and thus assume recipients will appreciate them less, even though recipients actually prefer gift cards in the more usable digital format.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text does discuss recipients’ preference of digital versus physical gift cards and the relative ease with which the two formats can be used, it doesn’t consider the misconceptions that gift givers may have of these factors. Moreover, the text establishes that recipients regard digital gift cards as easier to use and therefore preferable to physical gift cards. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t consider whether recipients of gift cards feel a sense of ownership toward them, nor does the text touch on the greater tangibility of physical versus digital gift cards. Instead, the text contrasts the two formats of gift cards in terms of their respective usability and the difficulty involved in acquiring them and discusses how those factors influence people’s perceptions of the two formats. Choice C is incorrect because it contradicts the text, which explains that recipients regard digital gift cards as superior to physical ones because they are easier to use than physical cards, not because physical gift cards require greater effort to obtain than digital gift cards do.

If the fossils are so poorly preserved that they cannot be conclusively identified as either organism, neither the claim that they are jellyfish nor, as Caron claims, that they are ctenophores would be supported.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Caron’s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyfish. These fossils are said to be \"of a similar age\" to the Cambrian fossils found in the Canadian Rockies. And nothing in the text or this choice suggests that the presence or absence of ctenophores after the Cambrian would have any bearing on whether the Cambrian fossils from the US and China are ctenophores. Choice C is incorrect. Caron’s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyfish. Nothing in the text suggests that the presence or absence of ctenophores in the Burgess Shale (in Canada) would affect whether the fossils found in the US and China are ctenophores. Choice D is incorrect. Caron’s claim is that fossils from the US and China are ctenophores, not jellyfish.

If Plato’s works tend to treat representational art as an inferior or inadequate reflection of the physical world (consistent with the idea of mere imitation), while Aristotle’s works suggest that the term \"mimesis\" can refer to art’s ability to show conditions that don’t currently exist but could exist (going beyond imitation into novel creation), that evidence would support the claim that the term \"mimesis\" means more than just \"imitation\" and that ancient Greek philosophers held different views of the relationship between art and reality.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because information about the root word mimos first being used in drama and the root mim- coming to be associated with music and poetry wouldn’t indicate anything about the meaning of the specific term \"mimesis\" as it was used by ancient Greek philosophers in discussions of representational art; thus, the information would have no bearing on Halliwell’s claim that a common translation of the specific term is an oversimplification. Choice B is incorrect because the issue of art’s psychological effects on audiences gets at how people respond to works of art instead of how art itself is related to reality, so the idea that Plato and Aristotle both addressed such effects in their considerations of mimesis wouldn’t have any bearing on Halliwell’s claim that a common translation of that term oversimplifies the relationship between art and reality. Further, this idea would touch on one general similarity in approaches to mimesis instead of illustrating the multifaceted, or varied, ways Halliwell claims ancient Greek philosophers understood art’s relation to reality.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the potential effects of logging on forest conservation. The text begins by stating that logging practices are often thought of as being contrary to forest conservation efforts. Then, the text presents the results of a research study examining the effect of limited logging practices on specific forest plots, finding that the plots with limited logging may be \"more robust\" (healthier) than the plots that hadn’t been logged at all. Given these results, it follows that logging may be a useful practice for maintaining healthy forests if it is practiced in a limited way.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the study referenced in the text only provides information on limited logging as a potential forest management strategy. There is no information in the text about how other forest management strategies support forest conservation efforts. Therefore, the text does not support the assertion that other forest management strategies are more successful than limited logging. Choice C is incorrect because the text presents a research study with findings that specific plots of forest with limited logging may be more robust than the forest plots that were not logged. Rather than suggesting that it is hard to know whether limited logging might be beneficial, the text suggests that the practice could be useful in forest conservation efforts. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses the results of a research study that compares the health of forest plots with limited logging to forest plots that were not logged. It does not take a position on the best way to support forest health but rather presents a research study with findings that question conventionally held thoughts regarding the practice of logging.",

In a 2020 study, Allen Kim, Charuta Pethe, and Steven Skiena claim that an observable pattern in such references reflects a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. The researchers drew this conclusion from an analysis of more than 50,000 novels spanning many centuries and cultures, using software to recognize and tally both specific time references—that is, clock phrases, such as 7 a.m. or 2:30 p.m.—and implied ones, such as mentions of meals typically associated with a particular time of day.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ conclusion that an observable pattern in time references in novels reflects a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. If novels published after 1880 contain significantly more references to activities occurring after 10 p.m. than novels from earlier periods do, this would suggest a change in human behavior and daily routines enabled by the availability of electric lighting. Before electric lighting—which provided illumination more easily than other available forms of light—many activities ceased after nightfall, so references to late-night activities would be less common in earlier novels. An increase in such references after 1880 would align with the researchers’ conclusion, reflecting an increase in late-night activities made possible by electric lighting.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because a decrease in references to 10 a.m. after the year 1800 would not support the researchers’ conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting toward the end of the 1800s. The time of 10 a.m. is in the morning and, in most places, characterized by daylight, so a change in references to that time would not be clearly linked to the impact of electric lighting. Choice C is incorrect because while an increase in implied time references relative to clock phrases in nineteenth-century novels could suggest a change in writing style or conventions, it does not directly support the conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting. The text indicates that the researchers’ conclusion is based on the content of the time references themselves, not the phrasing used. Choice D is incorrect. If references to noon and midnight are used with roughly the same frequency in all the novels analyzed by the researchers, this would reflect a lack of change in human behavior with regard to time and therefore would not support the researchers’ conclusion involving a shift in human behavior that occurred in response to the spread of electric lighting.",

Researchers Bernal and de Silva were curious if the mating calls were sufficient signals for the midges to locate the frogs or if midges also used carbon dioxide emitted by the frogs to locate their prey. The text then details the procedure the researchers used to investigate their question and summarizes their conclusion—that carbon dioxide does not serve as an additional cue to the midges. Thus, if more midges were found in the researchers’ trap that only played calls than in the trap that played calls and released carbon dioxide, it follows that the frog calls seem sufficient without the carbon dioxide cue.

The quotation presents the image of the moon shining on a body of water. However, instead of describing the moon in passive terms or simply stating that it reflects through the water and onto the sandy shore, the quotation portrays the moon as being engaged in the humanlike action of writing a legend. In other words, the moon is participating actively in the nighttime scene.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the quotation describes a nighttime scene on a body of water, the element of nature in these lines—the waves—isn’t portrayed as an active participant in an experience; instead, the waves merely ripple softly against a canoe, as waves would normally do. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation doesn’t present a nighttime scene on a body of water; instead, it describes petals falling from a rose. Choice D is incorrect. Although the quotation presents an image of an element of nature—the moon—it doesn’t mention a body of water; moreover, it portrays the moon not as an active participant in a scene but instead as static or unchanging (“ever and always the same”).",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student’s conclusion about banana ripening time with and without ethylene at different temperatures. The graph shows that at 20°C, the gap between the two bars showing ripening times for ethylene-treated bananas and untreated bananas crosses fewer than 2 gridlines (from about 4 days for ethylene-treated bananas to about 5.5 days for untreated bananas). Meanwhile, the graph shows that at 14°C, 16°C, and 18°C, the gap between the bars crosses more than 2 gridlines (from about 8 days for treated bananas to about 11 days for untreated bananas at 14°C; from about 6 days for treated bananas to about 9.5 days for untreated bananas at 16°C; and from about 5.5 days for treated bananas to about 8.5 days for untreated bananas at 18°C). Since the gap between the bars at each of these temperatures crosses more than 2 gridlines, and since each of these gaps is larger than the gap between the bars at 20°C, it can be concluded that ethylene was associated with a greater absolute change in ripening time at 14°C, 16°C, and 18°C than at 20°C.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the graph shows that ethylene-treated bananas stored at 20°C ripen more quickly than ethylene-treated bananas stored at the other temperatures do (about 4 days at 20°C vs. about 5.5, 6, and 8 days at 18°C, 16°C, and 14°C, respectively) and that untreated bananas stored at 20°C ripen more quickly than untreated bananas stored at the other temperatures do (about 5.5 days at 20°C vs. about 8.5, 9.5, and 11 days at 18°C, 16°C, and 14°C, respectively). The information in the graph therefore indicates that storing bananas at 20°C speeds up ripening time relative to storing bananas at the other temperatures shown, not that this storage temperature slows ripening time. Choice B is incorrect because the graph shows that as temperature increases, the ripening time of untreated bananas decreases, from about 11 days at 14°C to about 5.5 days at 20°C, with no exceptions to this trend. The graph therefore shows that differences in temperature were associated with absolute differences in ripening time, not that there was no association between differences in temperature and differences in ripening time. Choice C is incorrect because the graph shows that ripening times of ethylene-treated bananas at 14°C and 16°C were about 8 and 6 days, respectively, which is greater than, not less than, ripening times of ethylene-treated bananas at 18°C and 20°C, which were about 5.5 and 4 days, respectively. In other words, bananas treated with ethylene ripen more slowly, not faster, at 14°C and 16°C than at 18°C and 20°C.",

The text indicates that before 2006, all the estimated velocities of the LMC were within the range necessary to maintain orbit around the Milky Way galaxy. It then indicates that, according to Besla and colleagues, the 2006 estimate of 378 km/s is too high to maintain that orbit. This strongly implies that if the 1980 value (344 km/s) is below the orbital threshold, and if Besla and colleagues are correct that the 2006 value (378 km/s) is above that threshold, the maximum orbital velocity for the LMC must be somewhere in the range from above 344 km/s to below 378 km/s.\n\nChoice B is incorrect.

The text states that Suarez, Pérez-Huerta, and Harrell’s research on mosasaur tooth enamel led them to conclude that mosasaurs were endothermic, which means that they could live in waters at many different temperatures and still maintain a stable body temperature. The researchers claim that endothermy enabled mosasaurs to live in relatively cold waters near the poles. If several mosasaur fossils have been found in areas that were near the poles during the period when mosasaurs were alive and fossils of nonendothermic marine reptiles are rare in such locations, that would support the researchers’ claim: it would show that mosasaurs inhabited polar waters but nonendothermic marine mammals tended not to, suggesting that endothermy may have been the characteristic that enabled mosasaurs to include polar waters in their range.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that it’s easier to determine mosasaur body temperatures from tooth enamel data than it is to determine nonendothermic reptile body temperatures wouldn’t support the researchers’ claim. Whether one research process is more difficult than another indicates nothing about the results of those processes and therefore is irrelevant to the issue of where mosasaurs lived and what enabled them to live in those locations.   Choice B is incorrect because finding roughly equal numbers of mosasaur and nonendothermic marine reptile fossils in areas that were near the poles in the Late Cretaceous would suggest that endothermy didn’t give mosasaurs any particular advantage when it came to expanding their range to include relatively cold polar waters, thereby weakening the researchers’ claim rather than supporting it. Choice D is incorrect because finding that the temperature of seawater in the Late Cretaceous was warmer than seawater today wouldn’t weaken the researchers’ claim. Seawater in the Late Cretaceous could have been warmer than seawater today but still cold enough for endothermy to be advantageous to mosasaurs, so this finding wouldn’t provide enough information to either support or weaken the researchers’ claim.",

According to the text, conservationists have recently argued that this ecosystem-based approach may lead to better outcomes for all species in a location. If this ecosystem view is correct, then the single-species approach to conserving M. boolii would likely fail to consider how the cactus’s survival depends on its interactions with other species in Sonora’s ecosystem.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t address the distribution of Mammillaria species besides M. boolii throughout Mexico or discuss how that distribution affects survival. The text focuses specifically on M. boolii in Sonora and different approaches to its conservation. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that climatic changes in Sonora would reduce competition for M. boolii or that conservation efforts are focused on understanding this specific dynamic. In fact, the text implies that an ecosystem-based approach would consider climate among many other factors but doesn’t specify how climatic changes might affect competition between species.

It stands to reason that readers who had purchased the journal issue containing the poem would be unlikely to purchase an unchanged version of the poem in a stand-alone volume. However, the inclusion of notes in that volume would encourage the purchase of a stand-alone volume, since the later text would differ from the original by including the author’s own explanation of the poem.

In the quotation, Alexandra is described as enjoying looking at the stars and feeling a “sense of personal security” when she contemplates nature’s order and its governing laws. This suggests that Alexandra takes comfort in understanding the world around her. \n\nChoice A is incorrect because the quotation expresses how Alexandra Bergson attempts to meet difficult situations with determination, not how she takes comfort in understanding the world around her. Choice B is incorrect because the quotation expresses “how much the country meant to” Alexandra Bergson, not how she takes comfort in understanding the world around her. In detailing some of the wildlife surrounding Alexandra, the quotation conveys that nature is important to her but not necessarily that it gives her comfort. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation describes Alexandra driving her wagon down a highway at night; it doesn’t describe how she takes comfort in understanding the world around her or address how she’s feeling as she drives off.",

The text begins by explaining that the portrayal of Mexican American culture in Sandra Cisneros’s The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage. Noting that Cisneros’s novella was also influential for its depiction of a formative year in a female character’s youth, the text then claims that this depiction inspired other Latina authors to use fiction to explore their own experiences of youth. Since this claim addresses how Cisneros encouraged Latina authors specifically to portray their youthful experiences, it would be directly supported by such authors stating that her novella influenced them to write about their own adolescence, or the transitional period between childhood and adulthood.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. The text states that with its portrayal of Mexican American culture, The House on Mango Street inspired later authors to explore their own heritage, and since this statement isn’t limited to only Latina authors, it can be inferred that authors who aren’t Latina were also likely influenced by the novella. But because the claim in the underlined sentence concerns the novella’s influence on Latina authors specifically, the finding that the book also influenced authors who weren’t Latina would fail to provide support for the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that The House on Mango Street has sold millions of copies and is widely read among students in the US doesn’t relate directly to the text’s claim that the novella has influenced Latina authors specifically. Choice D is incorrect. While comparisons of new novels about young Latina characters by Latina authors to Cisneros’s The House on Mango Street would likely be founded on similarities between those novels and Cisneros’s novella, such similarities wouldn’t necessarily be evidence of the novella’s influence; such similarities might arise if Cisneros and younger Latina authors alike depicted certain basic cultural and historical features of their communities. Testimony from younger Latina authors about how The House on Mango Street had inspired them would be far more persuasive evidence of the novella’s influence.",

The 10th century spans the years from 901 to 1000 CE, so Siemomysł is believed to have ruled earlier than Mieszko II Lambert did, not later as this choice states. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text mentions that information in the written chronicle Gesta principum Polonorum draws its information about Siemomysł from the oral tradition, it doesn’t mention orally transmitted stories about Mieszko II Lambert. Instead, it states that the chronicle’s documentation of Siemomysł relies on oral tradition unlike the records of later rulers do, which suggests that the documentation of later rulers such as Mieszko II Lambert did not rely on oral tradition. Thus, no comparison can be made about how convincing the orally transmitted stories of each ruler are to historians.",

The text says that rivers appear yellow when they contain a lot of sediment and appear red when they contain a lot of algae. It goes on to explain that Gardner and colleagues measured the wavelengths of light for different segments of rivers in the United States and classified those wavelength measurements into colors: red for wavelengths of 495 nanometers and below, blue for wavelengths between 495 and 560 nanometers, and yellow for wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above. Combined with the earlier information about river colors, this suggests that rivers rich in sediment will have wavelengths of 560 nanometers and above (since such rivers appear yellow). If researchers found that Missouri River segments flowing into lakes tend to have wavelengths above 560 nanometers and segments flowing out of lakes tend to have wavelengths below 560 nanometers, this finding would support Gardner and colleagues’ conclusion, since it would suggest that the river tends to carry more sediment when it flows into lakes than when it flows out of lakes. \n\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that sections of the Missouri River with high chlorophyll-a levels have wavelengths between 490 and 560 nanometers would be irrelevant to the researchers’ conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes are richer in sediment than are segments of the river flowing out of lakes. This finding would not indicate anything about segments flowing into or out of lakes. Choice B is incorrect because finding that lakes through which the Missouri River passes have higher wavelengths near their shores than in the center would not support the researchers’ conclusion that segments of the river flowing into lakes have more sediment than segments flowing out of lakes. This finding would suggest only that there is more sediment around the edges of lakes than in their centers, which does not have any direct bearing on the researchers’ conclusion about river segments flowing into and out of lakes. Choice C is incorrect because finding that most segments of the Missouri River have wavelengths significantly higher than 560 nanometers would suggest that most segments of the river are high in sediment, not that segments flowing into lakes are higher in sediment than segments flowing out of lakes.

The text indicates that echinoderms have radially symmetrical body plans (symmetrical around a central point, usually in the form of a star), whereas most animals have bilaterally symmetrical body plans (symmetrical along an axis running from head to tail through a trunk). According to the text, sea stars are unusual echinoderms because, despite their radial body plan, they descended from known bilateral ancestors. This shift in body plan was thought to be a process of losing the genetic markers associated with the head region. The text explains that by comparing the genes of one sea star species (P. miniata) to those of a close relative, the acorn worm, researchers determined that instead, anterior (head) genes are active across the sea star’s entire body, posterior (tail) genes are active in limited, peripheral locations of the body, and no trunk-related genes are active. This finding strongly suggests that, rather than becoming \"headless\" as they evolved from a bilateral ancestor, sea stars developed a body plan consisting almost entirely of a head region with a minimal tail region and no trunk region present.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t identify how any particular region of sea stars’ bodies influences the layout of sea stars’ radial symmetry. Moreover, the text indicates that the radial symmetry of echinoderms is \"usually starlike,\" not that a starlike layout distinguishes sea stars from other echinoderms.

According to the text, ULE is influenced by urban population growth and by gross domestic product (GDP) growth per capita. Reasoning that efficient national governments provide urban services and infrastructure needed to attract economic investment, Mahtta et al. suggest that, as governments become more efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure, GDP growth per capita will account for more ULE and urban population growth will account for less. But according to the graph, Region 1 saw an increase in the percentage attributed to urban population growth from 1970–2000 (between 60 and 65%) to 2000–2014 (between 70 and 75%) and a decrease in the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970–2000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000–2014 (about 25%). Because the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita decreased (the opposite of what Mahtta et al. claimed would happen if the governments had become more efficient), the data suggest that the governments of Region 1 became less efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure over that period.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Neither the graph nor the text gives the regions’ relative levels of economic growth or what effect Mahtta et al. would expect such growth to have. Furthermore, Mahtta et al.’s proposal suggests that Region 1’s decline in the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970–2000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000–2014 (about 25%) would suggest decreasing, not increasing, government efficiency over this time. Choice C is incorrect. Neither the text nor the graph provides information about the relative efficiencies of different governments in Region 2. Choice D is incorrect. Mahtta et al.’s proposal suggests that more efficient governments will have a higher percentage of their ULE driven by GDP growth per capita and a lower percentage driven by urban population growth. For Region 2, the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita increased from 1970–2000 (between 10 and 15%) to 2000–2014 (between 45 and 50%), but the opposite is true for Region 1, which saw the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita decline over the same period.

The text explains that an approach to trade liberalization involves engaging in processing imports, one type of which doesn’t require payment to a trade partner (processing with assembly) and one type of which requires upfront payment to a trade partner for raw materials (processing with inputs). The graph, which presents China’s imports for ordinary imports and both types of processing imports in the years 2000, 2003, and 2006, shows that while processing imports with assembly rose from about 250 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 750 hundred million dollars in 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply, increasing from approximately 650 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 2,300 hundred million dollars in 2006. Because processing with inputs requires firms to pay for materials (expending capital) and processing with assembly doesn’t, the sharper rise in processing imports with inputs suggests that Chinese firms’ assets—and thus their ability to engage in that type of processing imports—were relatively limited in (and before) 2000 and then substantially increased from 2000 to 2006.

The text explains that high reliance on natural-resource extraction can subject a developing country to economic shocks that can destabilize the local currency and introduce economic uncertainty that tends to keep investors away. In other words, although we may think otherwise, foreign investors are less willing to invest in projects in developing countries whose economies are heavily dependent on natural-resource extraction because those economies tend to exhibit instability that investors want to avoid.\n\nChoice A is incorrect.

But the text does not implicate the cost of these initial investments as a reason why foreign investment is less widely available than some might think. Choice B is incorrect.

Rather than arguing that the goal of developing countries is to become less dependent on foreign investment, as the phrasing of choice B suggests, the text focuses only on why foreign investors become less involved with such countries, which suggests that more investment would be preferable.

The text states that although it has been hypothesized that birds’ bill size should increase with habitat temperature (an adaptation that reflects the fact that birds can release excess heat through their bills), Probst and colleagues concluded after studying mean bill surface area in North American thrashers that this hypothesis was not fully supported. In other words, Probst and colleagues did not observe the predicted positive relationship between mean bill surface area and habitat temperature in the thrashers they studied. The data in the table about the ocellated thrasher support Probst and colleagues’ conclusion because this species has the greatest mean bill surface area (3.26 cm2\ncm squared\n), but its habitat has the lowest mean maximum temperature in the warmest month (27.56°C). If the hypothesis were fully supported, species such as the ocellated thrasher that have colder habitats would likely also have smaller bills.

If the hypothesis were fully supported, the Bendire’s thrasher and other species with warmer habitats would also have larger bills.

Although the Bendire’s thrasher has the second-smallest mean bill surface area of the species that are included in the table and although its habitat has the second-lowest mean minimum temperature in the coldest month, this habitat has the highest (rather than the lowest) mean maximum temperature in the warmest month. Moreover, the data about this species’ bill surface area and mean minimum temperature suggest that smaller bills are associated with colder habitats, supporting rather than challenging the hypothesis that bill size increases with habitat temperature. Choice B is incorrect because it misrepresents the data in the table. Although the Cozumel thrasher has the second-greatest mean bill surface area of the species that are included in the table, its habitat’s mean maximum temperature in the warmest month is not \"significantly higher\" than the mean maximum temperatures of the other habitats.

The text states that some scholars have dated the composition of Beowulf to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries due to the poem’s fit with that period’s historical context. The text goes on to say that while it is “not inconceivable that Beowulf emerged from such a context”—that is, it is possible that Beowulf was composed during the late ninth through eleventh centuries—there is linguistic evidence that the poem was composed earlier, in the seventh or eighth century. According to the text, favoring the historical context over the linguistic evidence requires justification that scholars have not yet supplied. In other words, the text suggests that scholars who favor the later composition date need to explain why the poem’s fit with historical context should take precedence over the linguistic evidence, but they have not yet done so. Thus, the main idea of the text is that while there is some plausibility to the later composition date, advocates for the later date have not compellingly addressed evidence suggestive of an earlier date. \n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text says that scholars who date the poem to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries have failed to account for the linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed earlier, not that the evidence those scholars cite in favor of their view is unreliable or that anyone has cast doubt on that evidence. In other words, the text does not suggest that there are problems with the evidence cited by advocates of the later composition date, only that there is other evidence of an earlier composition date that those advocates need to consider. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that those scholars who date the poem to the late ninth through early eleventh centuries are giving priority to a controversial view of the social conditions at that time. The text makes no reference to any controversy about how scholars interpret that historical period. Instead, the text suggests that scholars who date the poem on the basis of its fit with the historical context of England in the late ninth through early eleventh centuries have failed to account for linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed earlier. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how well the poem fits the historical context of England in the seventh and eighth centuries, let alone that it fits that historical context as well as it fits the historical context of the late ninth through early eleventh centuries. Rather, the text says that there is linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed in the seventh or eighth century.",

The text explains that Vaiglova, Liu, and their colleagues analyzed the chemical composition of sheep, goat, and cattle bones from the Bronze Age in China in order to investigate the animals’ domestication, or their adaptation from a wild state to a state in which they existed in close connection with humans. According to the text, the team’s analysis showed that sheep and goats of the era fed largely on wild plants, whereas cattle fed on millet—importantly, a crop cultivated by humans. If analysis of the animal bones shows that the cattle’s diet also consisted of wheat, another crop cultivated by humans in China during the Bronze Age, the finding would support the team’s conclusion by offering additional evidence that cattle during this era fed on human-grown crops—and, by extension, that humans raised cattle relatively close to the settlements where they grew these crops, leaving goats and sheep to roam farther away in areas with wild vegetation, uncultivated by humans.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because if it were true that sheep’s and goats’ diets consisted of small portions of millet, which the text states was a crop cultivated by humans, the finding would suggest that sheep and goats were raised relatively close to human settlements, weakening the team’s conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to those settlements than sheep and goats were.

The text indicates that scholars used to believe that during the Classic period, the Maya civilization didn’t have agricultural marketplaces. According to the text, scholars held this view because they misunderstood the ecology of areas where the Maya lived. The text points out that people tend to create marketplaces in order to acquire resources they don’t otherwise control. Agricultural marketplaces would have allowed farmers who produced one type of crop to trade that crop for other types of crops that they didn’t produce. The text goes on to say, however, that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Maya landscape produced a smaller range of resources than it actually produced. Taken together, then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that marketplaces wouldn’t have allowed Maya people to acquire products different from the products they already produced: that is, if everyone produced the same array of crops, as scholars mistakenly believed, then there wouldn’t have been any need for marketplaces where people could trade those crops.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t say anything about trade between the Maya and people from outside the regions controlled by the Maya. Although scholars’ mistaken belief that the Maya lands weren’t very ecologically diverse would give those scholars a reason to think that the Maya didn’t have marketplaces, it wouldn’t lead scholars to assume that traders from outside Maya lands were uninterested in acquiring resources produced by the Maya. Even if the Maya actually did produce only a small array of resources throughout their lands, there is no reason to believe from the text that people outside Maya lands also produced these same resources and thus would have no need to trade with the Maya people. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that scholars underestimated the ecological diversity of the Maya lands, which suggests that they mistakenly believed that the Maya produced a relatively small array of resources throughout their territory, not that the crops the Maya produced varied significantly throughout the Maya lands. Although the scholars might have assumed that a lack of ecological diversity suggests that Maya farming practices were largely the same everywhere, the text does not support that they also assumed there was a lot of variation in the crops that Maya people produced. In fact, the text states that marketplaces emerge when people want to obtain resources they don’t already control. If it were the case that scholars assumed that the crops Maya people produced varied significantly, this would have led them to conclude that Maya people likely established marketplaces so they could trade for resources they didn’t already possess, not that the Maya civilization lacked marketplaces. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that scholars assumed that farmers wouldn’t trade their agricultural products unless they had already met their own needs with those products. Instead, the text says that scholars thought that the Maya lands produced a smaller array of resources than they actually did, which the text suggests led scholars to assume that the Maya didn’t have any need for marketplaces.

Although antihydrogen ballistics observations were conducted at CERN, the text provides no evidence that they were conducted to test conclusions in Dimopoulos et al.’s 2022 paper. Rather, the text presents the 2023 report as new evidence that contradicts the existence of the hypothetical phenomenon that Dimopoulos et al. had considered. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Dimopoulos et al. assumed that unambiguous proof of antigravity would be unattainable. Rather, the text states that they argued antigravity was worth considering theoretically because evidence against it was lacking at that time. At the same time, the results in the 2023 report do not undermine but strengthen the idea that the proof of antigravity might not be achievable. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that there was an \"inordinate focus on theoretical considerations\" before 2023 or that such a focus hindered the development of experimental methods. In fact, the text describes Dimopoulos et al.’s position regarding the theoretical consideration of antigravity as \"rightly argued,\" indicating approval of their approach given the absence of experimental evidence at that time.",

A research team led by Ruiwen Fan may have solved the mystery, concluding that the alpaca is the domesticated form of the vicuña but that the modern alpaca gets only 64 percent of its genetic material from its wild ancestor. The rest comes from the domesticated llama. The llama, meanwhile, gets 95.5 percent of its genetic material from its own wild ancestor, the guanaco, and the rest from the alpaca.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents the inference that most logically follows from the text’s discussion of the genetic material of alpacas. The text states that modern alpacas get only 64 percent of their genetic material from their wild ancestor (the vicuña), while llamas get 95.5 percent of their genetic material from their wild ancestor (the guanaco). These data imply that relative to llamas, alpacas have experienced a much greater genetic shift away from their wild ancestors (36 percent of their genetic material derives from another source, compared to 4.5 percent of llamas’ genetic material). Moreover, the text establishes that the remainder of alpacas’ genetic material derives from llamas, and the remainder of llamas’ genetic material derives from alpacas, reflecting a period of interbreeding. Taken together, these details support the inference that the period of interbreeding had a more significant impact on the genetic material of alpacas than on that of llamas, thereby reducing the percentage of alpacas’ genetic material that derives from wild ancestors and placing alpacas at a greater remove from these ancestors.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide information about genetic diversity within modern llama and alpaca populations. While the text discusses the percentage of genetic material each domesticated species inherited from its wild ancestor and from interbreeding, it does not address the level of genetic variation within each species. Therefore, it isn’t logical to infer that modern llama populations have a greater degree of genetic diversity than modern alpaca populations do. Choice B is incorrect because it contradicts the chronology presented in the text. The text states that alpacas were domesticated about 7,000 years ago, but the interbreeding with llamas occurred \"between 400 and 600 years ago.\" The genetic mixing happened thousands of years after domestication, not during it; in addition, the text does not provide details about what the process of domestication might entail. Therefore, it isn’t logical to infer that llama genetic material was introduced during the domestication process of alpacas. Choice D is incorrect because though the text notes that guanacos and vicuñas contributed to the genetic material of alpacas and llamas, it only discusses alpacas’ and llamas’ genetic composition. Therefore, the text does not support the inference that modern populations of guanacos and vicuñas would likely show traces of ancient interbreeding.",

This claim is weakened, however, by the fact that the enclosure without lizards also saw a substantial reduction in the number of spiders.

    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the influence of decision-making modes on consumers’ choices of different electricity plans. The Affect Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode describes choices based on the decision-maker’s social motivations, and the Calculation Mode describes choices based on minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, if those using a Calculation Mode disfavor the green plan, it would be due to some financial or convenience burden the green plan imposes that the other doesn’t. The text indicates that the green plan had a lower financial cost but was nonetheless rejected by participants using the Calculation Mode. It therefore follows that the green plan likely imposed a convenience burden that outweighed potential financial savings for these participants.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, unlike the Affect or Role Modes, the Calculation Mode would almost certainly involve taking price differences into account. Choice B is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, there is no reason to think that participants using the Calculation Mode at any point took social responsibility into account, let alone think that they discovered a disparity between their expectations and reality. Choice D is incorrect. According to the text, the Affect Mode involves the decision-maker’s preferred emotional outcome, the Role Mode involves social motivations, and the Calculation Mode is oriented toward minimizing financial costs and maximizing the decision-maker’s convenience. Thus, the text doesn’t indicate that cost-effectiveness is a factor for participants using the Affect or Role Modes, and there is no basis to compare their beliefs in the truthfulness of the green-plan description with those of the Calculation Mode users.",

The fish that live in rivers and those that live in caves show no significant genetic differences and are all capable of making the same sounds. The text indicates, however, that Hyacinthe and colleagues found that sounds that the river fish use in a particular context and for a particular purpose are used in a different context and for a different purpose by the cave fish. Additionally, the sounds made by cave fish show some differences depending on the specific cave the fish inhabit. The text goes on to state that Hyacinthe and colleagues have noted that differences in how the fish use sound to communicate could eventually become so great that they prevent fish from different locations from interbreeding. In other words, the river fish might eventually only breed with other river fish (with whom they share characteristics regarding sonic communication that they do not share with cave fish), while the cave fish might only breed with other cave fish for a similar reason.

The text indicates that although some scientists have assumed that iridescence could attract predators, Kjernsmo’s team wondered if iridescent insects might be harder for other animals to see. The team tested this idea by asking human participants to look for both iridescent beetle wings and beetle wings that weren’t iridescent but that had been painted colors such as purple or blue. If participants located most of the purple or blue wings but far fewer of the iridescent wings, that finding would support the team’s idea since it would suggest that noniridescent wings are easier to see than iridescent wings.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because if participants located the iridescent wings more quickly than the purple or blue wings, that finding would weaken the team’s idea, not support the team’s idea, since it would suggest that the iridescent wings were easier to see than the noniridescent wings. Choice C is incorrect because finding that some participants believed that the purple wings were easier to see than the blue wings would be irrelevant to the team’s idea. The purple and blue wings were both noniridescent, so any difference in how easy those two colors were to see would have nothing to do with the idea that iridescent insects are harder to see than noniridescent insects. Choice D is incorrect because if some participants found all the wings, that wouldn’t support the team’s idea that iridescent insects may be harder to see than noniridescent insects. If anything, this finding might weaken the team’s idea since it could suggest that iridescence had no effect on how difficult the wings were to see.",

Until an almost complete fossil skeleton was found in Brazil, paleontologists had been able to study only skull specimens from T. navigans, though it was presumed that, like other pterosaurs, the species’s primary form of locomotion was powered flight. Examining the fuller skeleton in 2016, Victor Beccari and his team determined that T. navigans had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck—characteristics that, combined with the creature’s large-crested head, would have made sustained flight difficult and walking upright relatively comfortable.

The text first describes what paleontologists initially speculated to be true of T. navigans based on observing only fossilized skulls of the pterosaur rather than complete skeletons—namely, that T. navigans had an oversized head crest and that, like other pterosaurs, its main mode of movement must have been flight. The text goes on to describe what researcher Victor Beccari and his team concluded based on studying a nearly complete fossilized skeleton of T. navigans, which provided additional information that fossilized skulls alone could not. Beccari and colleagues determined that T. navigans had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck, in addition to the oversized head crest previously observed by paleontologists. Taken together, these characteristics would have made sustained flight difficult and upright walking comfortable, which would make T. navigans different from other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Thus, Beccari and colleagues suggest that previously held speculations of paleontologists are inaccurate: that instead of moving mainly through powered flight, T. navigans likely flew for shorter distances and spent more time walking than researchers previously thought.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because Beccari and his team determined, based on their examination of a nearly complete skeleton, that T. navigans would have found \"sustained flight difficult,\" which would differentiate it from most other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Therefore, Beccari’s team would not suggest that T. navigans flew for longer distances than did other pterosaur species with large head crests. Choice B is incorrect because the fossilized skeleton studied by Beccari and colleagues was notable for its short wings, and because no indication in the text is made that other pterosaurs were thought by paleontologists to be comfortable walking. Therefore, Beccari’s team would not suggest that T. navigans had longer wings than other pterosaur species considered to have been comfortable walking. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Beccari and his team agree with the paleontologists mentioned earlier in the text that T. navigans had a large-crested head.

This implies an exaggerated sense of his own abilities, which matches the claim we’re trying to support.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. This quotation doesn’t describe Proudie’s view of himself, nor does it paint him in an especially flattering light. Instead, by saying his mental powers and business skill are not \"proved,\" it implies that he is actually dim-witted and bad at business. Choice C is incorrect. This choice describes Proudie’s closeness to power and importance, but it doesn’t show what Proudie thinks of himself. Proudie is not describing himself or his abilities here. The narrator is. Choice D is incorrect. While this quotation offers Proudie very mild praise, it doesn’t show what Proudie thinks of himself or his own abilities, which is what the claim focuses on.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Instant Mural. According to the text, the 1974 work Instant Mural involved taping two Asco members (Patssi Valdez and Humberto Sandoval) to an outdoor wall as a direct commentary on constraint (limitation or restriction). The text suggests that instead of focusing on Valdez’s role in the work and on social limitations women faced at the time—an approach that fails to explain the role of Sandoval, a man—people should consider that in 1974 (and long before) the art establishment limited recognition of Chicano artists to those who created murals with social and historical subjects, making it challenging for nonmuralist Chicano artists (such as Asco’s members) to show their work. The text suggests that considering the situation with the art establishment leads to a conclusion that accounts for the fact that Instant Mural is explicitly about constraint and features both a woman and a man taped to the wall: Instant Mural isn’t a reflection of the social constraints placed on women specifically but instead is a reflection on the constraining aesthetic expectations placed on Chicano artists in general (that is, the limits resulting from the lack of recognition of Chicano artists of any gender who did not create sociohistorical murals).\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The text indicates that the art establishment in 1974 (and earlier) did recognize Chicano muralists to the exclusion of other Chicano artists, so there’s no reason to assume Asco’s work Instant Mural was intended to represent Chicano muralists’ frustration; it’s far more likely that Asco’s members—described as Chicano nonmuralists—were representing their own frustration at being unrecognized by the art establishment. Choice B is incorrect. The text emphasizes that while a common approach to Instant Mural focuses on Valdez and the social limitations women faced in 1974 but fails to account for the presence of a man in the work, there is a conclusion that explains Sandoval’s role. But concluding that Instant Mural represents a double constraint experienced specifically by female Chicano artists would still fail to account for the inclusion of a man in the work. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text suggests that Instant Mural can be understood as something other than a commentary on social constraints women faced in 1974, it doesn’t suggest that the work is best understood as a critique of the content of any other artworks. The text doesn’t address how Chicano culture is depicted in sociohistorical murals; it discusses such murals only to make the point that in 1974 (and earlier) the art establishment recognized Chicano artists who produced them to the exclusion of Chicano nonmuralists, indicating a constraint all of Asco’s members faced, regardless of gender.",

The text goes on to state that the infected ants end up doing less work to sustain the colony and that as a result, the uninfected ants take on the infected ants’ share of labor in addition to caring for them in their infected state. The study’s researchers also observed that the uninfected ants have shorter lifespans than expected. If the infected ants, who are doing less work in the colony, have longer lifespans, it can be inferred that the less an ant works, the longer it will live. The opposite of this statement can also be inferred: the more an ant works, the shorter its life. So, since the workload within the colony is being redistributed so that the infected ants work less while the uninfected ants work more (as they take on the neglected duties of the infected ants and also care for those ants), then it can be inferred that the lifespans of the uninfected ants are shortened because the need to compensate for reduced contributions within the colony while also caring for infected workers is burdensome to the uninfected workers.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text does not indicate how A. brevis is transmitted to the ants or assert that uninfected ants are more likely to be directly exposed to A. brevis while caring for infected ants.

Near Vancouver Island in Canada, the otter population is large and well established, yet the eelgrass meadows are healthier than those found elsewhere off Canada’s coast. To explain this, conservation scientist Erin Foster and colleagues compared the Vancouver Island meadows to meadows where otters are absent or were reintroduced only recently. Finding that the Vancouver Island meadows have a more diverse gene pool than the others do, Foster hypothesized that damage to eelgrass roots increases the plant’s rate of sexual reproduction; this, in turn, boosts genetic diversity, which benefits the meadows’ health overall.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken Foster’s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots improves the health of eelgrass meadows by boosting genetic diversity. The text indicates that sea otters damage eelgrass roots but that eelgrass meadows near Vancouver Island, where there’s a large otter population, are comparatively healthy. When Foster and her colleagues compared the Vancouver Island eelgrass meadows to those that don’t have established otter populations, the researchers found that the Vancouver Island meadows are more genetically diverse than the other meadows are. This finding led Foster to hypothesize that damage to the eelgrass roots encourages eelgrass reproduction, thereby improving genetic diversity and the health of the meadows. If, however, other meadows not included in the study are less healthy the larger the local otter population is and the longer the otters have been in residence, that would suggest that damage to the eelgrass roots, which would be expected to increase with the size and residential duration of the otter population, isn’t leading meadows to be healthier. Such a finding would therefore weaken Foster’s hypothesis.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that small, recently introduced otter populations are near other eelgrass meadows in the study wouldn’t weaken Foster’s hypothesis. If otter populations were small and only recently established, they wouldn’t be expected to have caused much damage to eelgrass roots, so even if those eelgrass meadows were less healthy than the Vancouver Island meadows, that wouldn’t undermine Foster’s hypothesis. In fact, it would be consistent with Foster’s hypothesis since it would suggest that the greater damage caused by larger, more established otter populations is associated with healthier meadows. Choice B is incorrect because the existence of areas with otters but without eelgrass meadows wouldn’t reveal anything about whether the damage that otters cause to eelgrass roots ultimately benefits eelgrass meadows. Choice D is incorrect because the health of plants other than eelgrass would have no bearing on Foster’s hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots leads to greater genetic diversity and meadow health. It would be possible for otters to have a negative effect on other plants while nevertheless improving the health of eelgrass meadows by damaging eelgrass roots.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student’s conclusion about beehive structure. The text explains that in the hives of honeybees, the hexagonal cells housing drone eggs are larger than the hexagonal cells housing worker eggs, and that this size difference results in a construction problem that the bees address by using nonhexagonal cells to fill gaps between sections of drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells. The text also states that the size difference between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells varies by species of honeybee. The graph displays data on the percentage of nonhexagonal cells in the hives of three species. In the hives of the western honeybee, the percentages of five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells are all less than 0.5%. But in the hives of the black dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are higher than those for the western honeybee: about 2.5% for both. And for the dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are also higher than those for the western honeybee: slightly over 2.5% and slightly over 2.0%, respectively; additionally, the dwarf honeybee possesses a higher percentage of eight-sided cells than the western honeybee does. Taken altogether, the graph shows that the hives of the western honeybee consist of a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells than the hives of the two other species do. Since the nonhexagonal cells exist only to solve the construction problem arising from the difference in size between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells, a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells would be associated with a smaller size difference between the two types of cells. Therefore, it can be concluded from the data that worker-egg cells are probably closer in size to drone-egg cells in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the other two species.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because, as the text states, honeybee species deposit their eggs in hexagonal cells, not in nonhexagonal ones. Thus, the western honeybee and black dwarf honeybee wouldn’t deposit drone eggs in eight-sided cells, and the dwarf honeybee wouldn’t deposit drone eggs in seven-sided cells. Choice C is incorrect. The text explains that honeybees rely mainly on one geometric shape, the hexagon, when constructing their hives, and the graph shows that the western honeybee relies on the same nonhexagonal shapes as the dwarf honeybee does: five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells. In other words, the western honeybee and dwarf honeybee rely on the same number of geometric shapes. For the black dwarf honeybee, the graph displays data only for five-sided and seven-sided cells, which suggests a total absence of eight-sided cells. Yet this would be only one less nonhexagonal shape than is seen in the western honeybee. Thus, based on the graph, it would be inaccurate to say that the western honeybee relies on \"many more\" geometrical shapes than the other two species do. Choice D is incorrect. As the text explains, honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal cells, and sections of nonhexagonal cells are used to connect sections of hexagonal cells of different sizes. Since the graph indicates that the percentage of nonhexagonal cells is lower for the western honeybee than it is for the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee, the western honeybee would conversely have a higher percentage of hexagonal cells than the either the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee does, not a lower percentage.",

The text then states that the New Mexican dialect differs greatly from other Spanish dialects in that it still has characteristics of an older Spanish that other dialects eventually lost. After asking why this might be, the text points out that the New Mexico colony was distant from Spain’s other colonies, making it less attractive to colonists after the initial colonization. This geographic isolation limited the colony’s exposure to other Spanish colonists who would have otherwise introduced the changes to the Spanish language that occurred in their respective colonies. It can therefore be inferred that this isolation is a reason why the New Mexican dialect still has characteristics of an older Spanish, while the Spanish dialects spoken in less isolated areas that have more interaction with speakers of other dialects would lose those characteristics over time.

The text then contrasts such studies with more straightforward studies, using the example of a fitness study that wants only to find out how many regular exercisers in a particular location do weight training, that may not demand a large budget. The contrast emphasized in the text most directly suggests that the fitness study may cost less than a study like HILDA because the fitness study aims only to determine a current percentage and thus can be completed well without extending data collection over years.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text explicitly introduces the idea of a less expensive, straightforward fitness study as a contrast to many longitudinal studies that, like HILDA, have high costs because they require data collection over many years.

The text explains that plant specialists are working to develop shorter corn varieties in an effort to improve yields. The text points out that although greater height in corn plants can lead to more ears of corn per plant, it also makes the stalks more likely to be damaged by strong winds before there is a chance to harvest the corn. This presents a clear trade-off between potential yield (taller plants producing more ears per plant) and harvest reliability (shorter plants surviving until harvest time). Given this information, it is reasonable to infer that shorter corn varieties, while possibly producing fewer ears per plant, would be more likely to survive until harvest time. This survival advantage would result in improved yields of harvested corn because more plants would remain intact, thus offsetting the potential reduction in ears per shorter plant.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. According to the text, greater height makes cornstalks vulnerable to snapping or being uprooted in strong winds, implying that taller plants—not shorter ones—have greater stability problems. The text provides no basis for inferring that shorter corn varieties would be more likely to be uprooted due to corn weight; in fact, the text suggests the opposite relationship between height and stability. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t provide information about the land requirements of either shorter corn varieties or shorter wheat and rice varieties, much less make any comparisons. The text mentions that plant breeders in the 1950s and ’60s created shorter varieties of wheat and rice with improved yields and that researchers are now exploring shorter corn varieties, but it doesn’t compare land-use requirements of these crops. Choice D is incorrect because the idea that shorter cornstalks would yield more ears of corn would contradict the relationship between height and corn production described in the text. The text explicitly states that greater height allows individual plants to produce more ears of corn, which suggests that shorter varieties would produce fewer ears per plant, not more. The text therefore provides no basis for concluding that shorter varieties would begin developing more ears than the taller varieties currently do.",

If it were true both that Kuulo Kataa was founded in the fourteenth century CE and that artifacts found in excavations of the settlement are from the thirteenth century CE, it would be reasonable to conclude that the artifacts weren’t created in the Kuulo Kataa settlement. That would suggest, then, that the artifacts originated somewhere else and eventually reached the settlement through trading or as people migrated.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the existence of thirteenth-century CE artifacts recovered during excavations of a settlement founded in the fourteenth century CE isn’t logically connected to artifacts from one century being more commonly recovered than artifacts from another century. Rather than suggesting anything about how frequently artifacts from different times are found, the existence of artifacts confirmed as predating the settlement’s founding suggests that those items arrived in Kuulo Kataa during or after its establishment. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on time periods and says nothing about which region the founders of Kuulo Kataa have been thought to come from; similarly, the text doesn’t suggest anything about where the thirteenth-century CE artifacts originated other than not from Kuulo Kataa. Therefore, it isn’t logical to conclude that the mere existence of artifacts confirmed as predating the Kuulo Kataa settlement suggests that the founders of the settlement came from a particular region other than one previously assumed. Choice D is incorrect because the existence of artifacts from the thirteenth century CE at a site dated to the fourteenth century CE doesn’t imply that fourteenth-century objects were damaged during excavations. There’s nothing in the text to suggest that any objects were damaged; rather, the existence of artifacts confirmed as predating the settlement’s founding suggests that those items were brought to Kuulo Kataa during or after its establishment.",

The experiment included two mycorrhizal hosts (corn and marigold) and one nonmycorrhizal species (broccoli). Given the claim in the text that nonmycorrhizal species will see either no difference or a decrease in mass when exposed to mycorrhizal fungi, the student would likely have been surprised by the higher average mass for broccoli grown in the presence of the fungi than the broccoli grown in the soil treated to kill fungi.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the corn data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host corn is more massive in the presence of the fungi likely fits with what the student expected and would therefore not be surprising. Choice C is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the marigold data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host marigold is more massive in the presence of the fungi is likely what the student expected and thus would not be surprising. Choice D is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the data in the table—when grown in soil treated to kill fungi, corn had an average mass of 3.8 g while broccoli had an average mass of 7g—and because making comparisons among the plants in the no-fungi condition, by itself, does not provide a basis to compare the average mass of mycorrhizal hosts and nonmycorrhizal species grown in the presence of the fungi with those grown in the soil treated to kill fungi.",

The text goes on to say that titanium dioxide wasn’t used to manufacture ink until the early 1900s, which means that ink containing this compound couldn’t have been available to mapmakers in the 1400s. Since mapmakers in the mid-1400s couldn’t have used ink with titanium dioxide, it follows that the Vinland Map couldn’t have been drawn by mid-1400s mapmakers.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the 2021 finding that the ink used to draw the Vinland Map wasn’t available until the early 1900s doesn’t imply that Europeans in the mid-1400s couldn’t have known about the eastern coast of North America. While this finding suggests that the map couldn’t have been created in the mid-1400s, it doesn’t preclude the possibility that Europeans nevertheless had knowledge—and perhaps even drew other maps that are no longer in existence or are yet to be discovered by researchers—of the eastern coast of present-day North America as early as the mid-1400s. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the 2021 discovery of the presence of titanium dioxide in the ink used to draw the Vinland Map caused Lemay, Zyats, and Bezur to question or reach a new conclusion about when mapmakers began using ink containing titanium compounds.

According to the text, Gálvez and colleagues found that the venom used by C. granosus both subdues prey and inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, a pathogen that, if ingested by C. granosus, would presumably cause disease unless neutralized in some way. If it were true that E. coli is commonly found in species preyed on by C. granosus and, moreover, can withstand C. granosus’s digestive juices after ingestion, this would suggest that C. granosus likely relies on another mechanism to neutralize E. coli to make E. coli-infected prey safe for consumption by the scorpion species. Given that, as the text states, C. granosus’s venom was found to inhibit the pathogen’s growth, it therefore follows that the venom provides protection for C. granosus against E. coli that its digestive system wouldn’t otherwise provide, making it reasonable to conclude that the trait may have spread through the species because it mitigates risk during feeding.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because a finding that E. coli doesn’t appear to be virulent, or dangerous, for C. granosus even when venom isn’t used would weaken rather than strengthen Gálvez and colleagues’ conclusion that a particular form of venom production spread in C. granosus in part because it helps reduce risk during feeing, since this finding would suggest that E. coli isn’t actually a risk to C. granosus when consuming prey. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that C. granosus can detect and avoid consuming E. coli-infected prey in the first place would suggest that an ability other than venom production is the primary factor that reduces C. granosus’s risk when feeding, which would suggest there has been less evolutionary pressure to develop venom that provides protection; thus, this finding wouldn’t clearly support the conclusion that C. granosus’s form of venom production spread in the species in part because it helps reduce risk during feeding. Choice D is incorrect because Gálvez and colleagues’ conclusion focuses on C. granosus venom in relation to the risk of E. coli, and a finding that the venom also inhibits nonpathogenic (not disease-causing) bacteria species, which presumably don’t pose a risk if consumed, wouldn’t be relevant to the conclusion that C. granosus’s particular form of venom production spread in the species in part because it helps reduce risk during feeding.",

To investigate swing, a team led by physicist Corentin Nelias delayed the downbeats and synchronized the offbeats in jazz piano solos and asked jazz musicians to compare the intensity of swing in each modified piece with the intensity of swing in the original piece.

The table lists the observatories where these instruments are housed, the type of data each instrument collected (infrared imaging or spectroscopy), and the years in which the instruments’ observations were made. According to the table, only two of these instruments obtained spectroscopy data: VISIR at the European Southern Observatory, which made its observations in 2006, and TEXES at the Gemini Observatory, which made its observations in later years (2007 and 2019). Although two other instruments are also included in the table, they obtained infrared imaging data, not spectroscopy data.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement about Rodrigo da Costa Portilho-Ramos and colleagues’ conclusion. The graph shows the ratio of manganese to calcium in L. pertusa coral samples from the Alboran Sea and the Mauritanian coast. The graph reflects time in approximate years before present: in other words, the greater the number in years noted on the graph’s horizontal axis, the farther that moment is in the past. The text indicates that the researchers tested the samples to determine whether oxygenation played a role in the decline of L. pertusa. The text goes on to note that a change in the ratio of manganese to calcium would signal an inverse, or opposite, change in oxygenation. According to the graph, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Alboran Sea increased from about 30 micromoles per mole 10,000 years ago to about 80 micromoles per mole 8,000 years ago, which means that oxygenation decreased between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago. Meanwhile, there was almost no discernible change in the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Mauritanian coast between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. According to the text, the population of L. pertusa declined significantly around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea and around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. Thus, the increase in the ratio of manganese to calcium around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea coincides with the decline in the L. pertusa population, suggesting an association between the decrease in oxygenation and the decline in population of the coral. No such relationship is suggested around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. So, oxygenation likely played a role in the L. pertusa decline in the Alboran Sea but not in the coral’s decline near the Mauritanian coast.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it asserts the opposite of what the graph indicates regarding oxygenation in the Alboran Sea, and it misrepresents what the graph indicates about oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast. The graph indicates that at the time of the decline in L. pertusa (approximately 9,000 years ago), the samples from the Alboran Sea contained a ratio of manganese to calcium that was increasing. According to the text, this ratio inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, so if the ratio was increasing, oxygenation was decreasing, not substantially increasing. Furthermore, the graph shows that the ratio of manganese to calcium remained relatively stable in coral samples from the Mauritanian coast during the period studied, which suggests that there was no discernible relationship between oxygenation and the coral’s population decline in that location, not that there was a substantial decrease in oxygenation corresponding to the coral’s decline. Choice C is incorrect. Although the graph suggests that the level of oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was higher before the decline in L. pertusa than after—because the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels and this ratio was lower before the decline than after—the graph doesn’t support the claim that oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low before and after the coral’s decline there. Rather, the graph indicates that relative to coral samples from the Alboran Sea, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low, which suggests that oxygenation levels were relatively high both before and after the decline of L. pertusa. Choice D is incorrect because it states the opposite of what the graph indicates: the graph shows that throughout the period studied, the ratio of manganese to calcium was higher in coral samples from the Alboran Sea than it was in samples from near the Mauritanian coast. Since the text indicates that the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was therefore lower than, not higher than, oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast during the period studied. Moreover, even if choice D did accurately represent the graph, it wouldn’t effectively complete the statement since a comparison of the ocean oxygenation levels at the two locations is not relevant to the claim that a decline in oxygenation levels was associated with the decline of L. pertusa in the Alboran Sea but not near the Mauritanian coast.",

Although the text does use the language of \"dash[ing] madly ahead\" in relation to time, the phrase appears in the context of a comparison illustrating how dogs experience time: time for a dog moves just as the hands of a clock do, in a circle and \"unwilling to dash madly ahead\"—that is, always in a regular and predictable way.",

    ],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it best describes data from the graph that support the researchers’ conclusion about whitefly-induced defenses in tomato plants. According to the text, tomato plants produce airborne chemicals that prompt nearby tomato plants to increase their production of appropriate defensive chemicals, such as jasmonic acid in response to herbivory and salicylic acid in response to microbial infection. The text goes on to indicate that researchers concluded that whiteflies induce tomato plants to emit chemicals that cause nearby plants to defend against microbial infection instead of herbivory from whiteflies. The graph shows that control tomato plants (plants that weren’t exposed to any chemicals from nearby tomato plants and weren’t subsequently infested with whiteflies) produced about 140 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight and about 120 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight, which indicates the baseline levels of these defensive chemicals in tomato plants. The graph also shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants produced about 205 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight when subsequently infested by whiteflies, which is more than the amount produced by the control plants. This suggests that when infested with whiteflies, tomato plants that weren’t previously exposed to air from nearby whitefly-infested plants begin producing higher levels of jasmonic acid to defend against the infestation. Finally, the graph also shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants and then subsequently infested by whiteflies produced approximately 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight (which is less than control plants did) and approximately 175 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight (which is more than control plants did). This suggests that whiteflies cause tomato plants to emit chemical signals that decrease nearby plants’ defenses against whitefly herbivory relative to baseline levels and redirect their defenses toward microbial infection, thereby supporting the researchers’ conclusion that whiteflies cause tomato plants to emit airborne chemical signals that induce nearby plants to preferentially defend against microbes even when experiencing herbivory from whiteflies.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the graph shows that tomato plants exposed to whitefly-infested plants produced less jasmonic acid than salicylic acid (about 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight vs. about 175 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight), and although this might suggest that those plants are therefore better defended against microbial attack than against herbivory, this wouldn’t be sufficient to conclude that this is the case: without reference to the relative levels of defensive chemicals produced by the plants in the other experimental conditions, it would be impossible to conclude that exposure to air from whitefly-infested plants either induces or diminishes these plants’ defenses to different kinds of threats. Furthermore, the graph shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants produced about 205 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight and about 130 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight, not that they produced the same amount of the two acids. Choice C is incorrect because it inaccurately describes the data in the graph. The graph shows that plants in all three conditions produced both jasmonic and salicylic acid, not that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants produce no jasmonic acid at all. Choice D is incorrect. Although the graph shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants produced about 100 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight when infested, which is less than the amount produced by control plants (about 140 nanograms per gram of dry weight), and although the graph shows that plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants produced about 205 nanograms of jasmonic acid per gram of dry weight when infested (which is more than the amount produced by control plants) and about 130 nanograms of salicylic acid per gram of dry weight (which is more than the approximately 120 nanograms per gram of dry weight produced by control plants), this wouldn’t support the researchers’ conclusion that plants exposed to air from whitefly-infested plants preferentially defend against microbial infection—that is, that they increase their levels of salicylic acid and decrease their levels of jasmonic acid relative to control plants. Rather, the data would suggest that exposure to air from whitefly-infested plants reduces plants’ defenses against herbivory, but these data wouldn’t indicate that whiteflies induce plants to redirect their defenses to guard against microbial infection. Furthermore, the data concerning plants exposed to air from whitefly-free plants merely indicate that these plants increase their defenses against both herbivory and microbial infection when infested by whiteflies.",

The text explains that at great depths in the ocean, extreme pressure compresses the molecular structure of water by destabilizing the hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules, thereby allowing water to penetrate proteins and harm the associated organisms. However, deep-sea organisms called piezophiles have adapted to live at these depths and previous studies show a positive correlation between the depth at which a piezophile species lives and the species’ level of the compound TMAO.

Although the researchers’ hypothesis suggests a relationship between TMAO and water molecules’ tetrahedral molecular structure, that relationship involves TMAO helping maintain water’s tetrahedral molecular structure under high pressure; as presented in the text, the hypothesis doesn’t contend that water molecules are impervious to, or incapable of being penetrated by, TMAO. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses how the molecular structure of water, not TMAO, is compressed under extreme pressure and never addresses how TMAO might be affected by such pressure. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers’ hypothesis holds that water under extreme pressure is more resistant, not less, to being compressed when TMAO concentrations are higher.

Referring to himself in the second person (with “thy”), the character exclaims “Beat at this gate that let thy folly in / And thy dear judgement out!” Lear refers metaphorically to his own mind as a gate that has allowed folly, or poor judgement, to enter and good judgement to escape.

The latter view is the argument that Paredes puts forward. If Mexican-American folklore collected in the twentieth century mostly consists of ballads about history and social life that originated recently, then that would support Paredes’s argument, since it would suggest that the folklore mostly arose after Spanish rule ended in the early nineteenth century and that the folklore reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than traditions from Spain. \n\nChoice A is incorrect because the inclusion of songs influenced by sixteenth-century Spanish poetry among Mexican-American folklore collected in the twentieth century would not support Paredes’s view that the folklore was the result of cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than an offshoot of Spanish folklore. If anything, the presence of such songs among the folklore collected in the twentieth century would weaken Paredes’s argument, since it would reflect the influence of Spanish culture on the folklore. Choice B is incorrect because the mere presence of similarities in Mexican-American folklore across regions would not be sufficient to draw a conclusion about where the folklore originated, let alone to support Paredes’s argument that the folklore reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States. In fact, since Paredes argued that Mexican-American folklore is the product of various cultures interacting in Mexico and the United States, he would likely expect there to be regional variations in folklore as different cultures have interacted in different places. Choice C is incorrect because scholars’ previous ignorance of the folklore would have no bearing on Paredes’s argument that Mexican-American folklore mostly reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the use of songs by the Kwakwaka’wakw people to record and communicate ecological knowledge. The text indicates that some songs of the Kwakwaka’wakw people of Canada’s Pacific Northwest region document how the people used terraced gardens in intertidal zones to cultivate clams for food. The text also explains that archaeological evidence shows increases in \"clam size and abundance\" that occurred along with the implementation of this cultivation method, suggesting the method’s efficacy in not just supporting clam yields but also improving them. It follows, then, that the use of intertidal terraced gardens, as described in the songs, allowed the ancestors of modern Kwakwaka’wakw people to maintain clams as a food source and to cultivate larger and more numerous clams.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention anything about cultivation practices among non-Indigenous people in the Pacific Northwest coastal region. Though the text conveys that archaeological evidence suggests that the clam cultivation practice mentioned in Kwakwaka’wakw people’s songs was efficacious when implemented, it gives no indication that people other than the Kwakwaka’wakw adopted that practice. Choice C is incorrect because the text provides no information about the archaeological record as it pertains to Sakha and Kaluli songs and doesn’t suggest that there is less corroboration of practices described in those songs than there is of the clam cultivation practice described in Kwakwaka’wakw songs. The Sakha and Kaluli songs are mentioned early in the text only as examples of Indigenous songs that contain ecological knowledge. Choice D is incorrect because archaeological evidence that clam size and abundance both increased when Kwakwaka’wakw ancestors implemented intertidal terraced gardens provides information only about the past use of that method and doesn’t suggest anything about present practices. The text indicates that knowledge of a past clam cultivation method is maintained in Kwakwaka’wakw songs but doesn’t indicate whether modern Kwakwaka’wakw people use that or other fishing and farming practices used by their ancestors.",

Although this quotation refers to several flowers (primroses and periwinkles) and indicates that the speaker is in a \"bower,\" or shady spot among the trees—details which suggest that the speaker is experiencing the sights of spring—it doesn’t suggest that the speaker is having contradictory feelings, only that the speaker believes that the flowers are experiencing enjoyment. Choice B is incorrect. Although this quotation focuses on the sights of spring—namely, new leaves on nearby trees appear to be opening up (\"The budding twigs spread out their fan\") to feel the breeze—the quotation doesn’t suggest that the speaker feels conflicted about this: the statement \"And I must think, do all I can\" suggests the speaker’s determination to attribute feelings of pleasure to the trees, not that the speaker is experiencing contradictory feelings. Choice C is incorrect. Although this quotation indicates that the speaker isn’t certain what the birds are thinking (\"Their thoughts I cannot measure\"), there’s nothing to suggest that the speaker is experiencing contradictory feelings.

Some of the dust’s material vaporizes in the atmosphere in a process called ablation, and the faster the particles move, the higher the rate of ablation. Astrophysicist Juan Diego Carrillo-Sánchez led a team that calculated average ablation rates for elements in the dust (such as iron and potassium) and showed that material in slower-moving SPC or AST dust has a lower rate than the same material in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust.

The table shows the ablation rates for three elements—iron, potassium, and sodium—found in cosmic dust that comes from one of four sources. The text says that the ablation rate for a given element in slower-moving SPC and AST dust was lower than the ablation rate for that same element in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust. The text then presents the first part of an example of this pattern, describing an ablation rate of 28% for iron in AST dust. The information that iron from HTC dust had an ablation rate of 90% is therefore the most effective way to complete this example—the comparison of a relatively low ablation rate for iron in slower-moving AST dust with a relatively high ablation rate for iron in faster-moving HTC dust illustrates the tendency of ablation rates for a given element to be lower in slower-moving dust than in faster-moving dust.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that SPC dust, like AST dust, moves relatively slowly; a comparison of the ablation rates of iron from two slower-moving dust sources could not be an example of the difference between ablation rates in slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, which is the pattern that the example is supposed to illustrate. Choice B is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the first part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium. Choice D is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the first part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium.

Although the table indicates that the cane toad tadpoles ate 90% of the cane toad eggs and 7% of the short-footed frog eggs, which suggests that they prefer cane toad eggs over short-footed frog eggs, the table also indicates that cane toad eggs produce bufadienolide, whereas short-footed frog eggs do not. Therefore, these data are not sufficient to exclude that bufadienolide alone could explain the tadpoles’ preference for some species’ eggs over other species’ eggs. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that for both dainty green tree frog eggs and little red tree frog eggs, the cane toad tadpoles ate 1% of those species’ eggs, it also indicates that neither produces bufadienolide. Thus, these data alone don’t indicate bufadienolide’s role in the tadpoles’ egg preferences.",

This shows that project leaders rated urban agriculture as contributing less to providing medicinal plants than to improving the local microclimate.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the graph doesn’t provide data about urban agriculture’s contribution to educational opportunities; therefore, this comparison can’t be made. Choice C is incorrect because it contradicts the data shown in the graph. On average, project leaders gave a rating of approximately 3 to urban agriculture’s contributions to improving the local microclimate, which is higher, not lower, than the average rating of approximately 2 that they gave to its contributions to providing medicinal plants. Choice D is incorrect because the graph doesn’t provide data about urban agriculture’s contribution to providing tourist attractions; therefore, this comparison can’t be made.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by noting a common intuition that lying might sometimes be permissible, which raises the question of what is the reason for being against lying. The text then presents Pallikkathayil’s answer to this question: we have a duty to respect others’ agential interests (that is, we have an obligation to allow people to exercise their free will in order to best serve their own ends), false beliefs constrain agency (the implication here being that people who are deceived about what is true are impeded in acting in their own best interests), and so we should not hinder the formation of true beliefs (we should not deliberately deceive a person) unless doing so prevents a greater limitation on someone’s agency or prevents some otherwise impermissible end (for example, it might be morally permissible to lie to someone in the rare circumstance where a false belief would lead a person to act in their own best interest, and where they would not do so if they knew the truth). Thus, the main idea of the text is that Pallikkathayil offers a potential justification for opposing lying based on respecting agency, while still allowing for exceptions in specific circumstances.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t focus on people’s lack of a principled way to identify circumstances where lying is permissible or indicate that Pallikkathayil’s argument resolves this specific problem. Rather, the text presents Pallikkathayil’s argument that lies limit agency but may be permitted in very specific situations (to prevent a greater limitation on someone’s agency or an otherwise unacceptable outcome) as one of a number of possible arguments about why lies are undesirable but sometimes permissible. Choice C is incorrect because it directly contradicts the text. Pallikkathayil’s argument, as described in the text, wouldn’t lead to an \"inviolable duty to speak truthfully.\" On the contrary, the text explicitly states that Pallikkathayil’s position is that interfering with people developing accurate beliefs is wrong, except when such interference prevents either a more significant limitation on someone’s agency or an outcome that would be unacceptable for other reasons. This indicates that Pallikkathayil’s argument allows for some exceptions to the duty to speak truthfully, making it not inviolable. Choice D is incorrect because Pallikkathayil’s argument doesn’t suggest that if it is permissible to lie in at least some circumstances, then it is unclear whether there are good reasons for opposing lying in any circumstances. Instead, the text presents Pallikkathayil as offering a specific ground for opposing lying (respecting others’ ability to act in their own best interests) while qualifying that assertion by presenting a situation in which lying might sometimes be morally permissible.",

The text explains that a team of researchers monitored the brain activity of dogs while the dogs listened to three recordings: one of spoken Spanish, one of spoken Hungarian, and one of scrambled fragments that weren’t recognizable as human speech. The text then states that the team concluded that differences in dogs’ anatomical features may affect their ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech. The finding that longer-headed dogs exhibited a greater difference in brain activity when listening to the speech recordings (in Spanish or Hungarian) versus the nonspeech (scrambled) recording compared with shorter-headed dogs would establish an association between an anatomical feature (head length) and responses (as measured by brain activity) to speech versus nonspeech. This observed relationship between head length and brain activity patterns during exposure to speech and nonspeech would support the team’s conclusion.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it describes a finding about dogs’ responses (as indicated by brain activity) to hearing their respective familiar languages rather than dogs’ ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech, which is what the team’s conclusion specifically addresses. Moreover, this finding pertains to only one anatomical type (long-headed dogs), so it wouldn’t support the conclusion that anatomical differences may affect dogs’ ability to distinguish speech from nonspeech.

As the text explains, researchers determined that Sidonian coins were made of silver and copper and that from 450 BCE to 367 BCE, the percentage of silver in each coin decreased from 98% to 74.2% while the percentage of copper increased from 1% to 24.7%. The text indicates that because the coins containing less than 80% silver weren’t considered suitable for trade (suggesting that copper was less valuable than silver) and looked different from coins containing more silver, the researchers suspect there was a serious loss in confidence in the currency in Sidon in 367 BCE when the copper content was high. It’s reasonable to assume that it wasn’t possible to boost confidence simply by devoting a greater amount of valuable silver to the currency, since Sidon was under significant and ongoing financial pressure; however, keeping the total amount of silver the same and reducing the amount of copper in the coins would have resulted in smaller coins with a higher percentage of silver. Therefore, it makes sense to suggest that Abd’aštart I (the ruler after 367 BCE) likely restored confidence in the currency by deciding to keep the amount of silver in Sidonian coins consistent with that in coins minted in 367 BCE but to decrease the coins’ weight.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text conveys that a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon likely occurred around 367 BCE because the percentage of silver in coins had fallen below 80% (presumably because Sidon’s financial pressures meant that less silver was available for currency), making the coins unsuitable for trade. Thus, announcing that the threshold for the percentage of silver in coins would be raised—that is, that coins would need to contain even more than 80% silver to be suitable for trade—likely would have worsened the crisis rather than relieved it. Choice C is incorrect because the text strongly suggests that a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon was caused by the proportion of silver to copper in the coins in 367 BCE, with 74.2% being too little silver for the coins to be considered suitable for trade; therefore, it’s unlikely that minting coins with a similar proportion of silver to copper (that is, still around 74.2% silver) would have restored confidence, even if the coins were heavier. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that funding the mining of more copper would have relieved a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon. The text establishes that Sidonian coins that visibly contained copper weren’t considered suitable for trade, so Abd’aštart I wouldn’t have wanted to add even more copper to them, and it’s unclear how else copper mining would affect views of the currency.",

Dressed in men’s trousers and a poncho, she would perform classic songs that had been written from a male point of view and were usually sung by men. She also altered those songs by performing them much more slowly than other ranchera singers did. The slower tempo allowed her to express the emotional quality of the lyrics more fully.",

According to the table, four of the gas exoplanets discovered by Rodriguez and colleagues have a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of less than 10 days, while one of the planets has a mass of at least 0.25 Jupiters and an orbital period of more than 10 days.

The Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a holding force of 56 newtons, four times greater than that of the Yale Model T. Additionally, the graph shows that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a weight of approximately 500 grams, slightly more than the Yale Model T’s weight of approximately 480 grams. Therefore, the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher ratio of holding force to weight than the Yale Model T. Since higher ratios correspond to greater payload capacity, the information from the graph indicating that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand weighs only slightly more than the Yale Model T combined with the information in the text ultimately supports the conclusion that the Ultra-Fast Robot Hand has a higher payload capacity than the Yale Model T.\n\nChoice A is incorrect.

The text explains that urchin barrens are areas that used to be kelp forests but are now covered by purple sea urchins. The text suggests that because there is no more vegetation to be consumed in those areas, the urchins exist in a state of starvation that makes them less nutritional for many predators. The text goes on to explain that in a study with a choice between two purple sea urchins, sunflower sea stars (a predator species that has been substantially declining) consumed a nutritionally rich urchin 42.7% of the time and a nutritionally poor urchin 37.5% of the time. Because the sunflower sea stars didn’t always avoid consuming nutritionally poor urchins, even when nutritionally rich ones were available, it follows that helping sunflower sea star populations to grow could help control urchin barrens by increasing the number of sea stars that may consume and thus remove nutritionally poor purple sea urchins from barrens.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates only that when presented with purple sea urchins, the sunflower sea stars in the study consumed both nutritionally rich and nutritionally poor ones.

In the absence of greater details, it wouldn’t have been possible for the film to be a precise retelling of the historical events it depicts. The quotation explains that to compensate for this lack of information about the meeting, Powers did extensive research into the four figures and how they thought at the time in order to speculate in an informed way about what they might have said or what might have occurred between them.

The text indicates that the ITCZ, a band of clouds in the tropics that is a significant rainfall source, can change position. Data from Peru’s Huagapo Cave suggest that the ITCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age. But according to the text, if the ITCZ moved into South America in that way, then Central America should have been drier than climate models suggest it was. In other words, rainfall should have been reduced in Central America because the ITCZ, a significant rainfall source, had shifted into South America, but climate models do not show such a reduction in Central America. The text goes on to say that Asmerom and colleagues tried to resolve this apparent conflict by collecting data from Yok Balum cave in Central America and comparing them with data from Huagapo, which led the researchers to conclude that the ITCZ may have expanded both northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. If it is true that Yok Balum in Central America and Huagapo in South America show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age, such a finding would support Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion by suggesting that the two areas were affected by the same rainfall source, and thus that the ITCZ may have expanded rather than shifted. \n\nChoice A is incorrect because there is no information in the text about how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature in areas where it is located. Rather, the text states that temperature variations across Earth’s hemispheres can shift the position of the ITCZ. Finding that neither Yok Balum nor Huagapo data show evidence of significant local variations in temperature during the Little Ice Age would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues’ claim. Choice B is incorrect because finding that both Yok Balum and Huagapo experienced prolonged dry conditions during the Little Ice Age would not support Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion that the ITCZ, a major source of rainfall, may have expanded northward and southward rather than simply shifting south. Dry conditions in both locations would suggest that the ITCZ did not cover either location. Additionally, finding that temperatures were elevated in both locations would have no clear bearing on Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion, since there is no information in the text that indicates how, if at all, the ITCZ affects temperature. Choice C is incorrect because finding that Yok Balum experienced prolonged dry conditions at the same time that Huagapo experienced high rainfall would weaken Asmerom and colleagues’ conclusion, not strengthen it.

According to the text, Barrett and Rayfield believe that estimates of dinosaur bite force may be strongly influenced by the methods used to produce them—that is, that different methods may produce significantly different results. The table shows that the studies by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. used the same estimation method (muscular and skeletal modeling) and produced similar bite force estimates (approximately 35,000–57,000 newtons and 35,000–63,000 newtons, respectively). The study by Meers, however, used body-mass scaling and produced a much higher bite force estimate (183,000–235,000 newtons), while the study by Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis and produced a much lower bite force estimate (8,000–34,000 newtons). The fact that one method produced similar estimates in two different studies and that two different methods used in other studies produced substantially different estimates supports the idea that dinosaur bite force estimates are significantly influenced by the methodology used to produce them.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table. The table does show that the studies by Meers and by Cost et al. used different estimation methods and produced very different ranges of estimated dinosaur bite force, which would support Barrett and Rayfield’s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different estimates. However, the table doesn’t show that the study by Meers produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force while the study by Cost et al. produced the highest. In fact, the study by Meers estimated a maximum bite force of approximately 235,000 newtons, which is the highest of all the estimated maximums. Choice B is incorrect. Although the data from Gignac and Ericson’s study are accurately described, a single set of findings from one study using only one methodology can’t show that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates, as Barrett and Rayfield suggest. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that the maximum bite force estimated by Cost et al. was higher than that estimated by Bates and Falkingham, the difference is relatively small; in fact, both teams estimated a minimum bite force of approximately 35,000 newtons and a maximum bite force close to approximately 60,000 newtons. Because these findings demonstrate that a single methodology (muscular and skeletal modeling) produced similar overall results in two studies, the findings don’t support Barrett and Rayfield’s suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates.",

    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, thousands of ceramic bowls were found in a recovered Chinese shipwreck. The text goes on to say that Niziolek and her team used a special tool, a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, to determine the bowls’ chemical signatures. Comparing these chemical signatures with the chemical signatures of materials they had collected from old Chinese kiln sites, the text says, allowed the researchers to identify which kilns had produced the bowls. In other words, the researchers determined the bowls’ origin.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the researchers used technology in the form of a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer, it doesn’t specifically state that this technology is new. In addition, the text says that Niziolek and her team used the tool to determine the chemical composition of bowls that were found in a Chinese shipwreck, not to locate and recover the shipwreck itself. There’s no indication in the text that a new technology can help researchers locate and recover shipwrecks. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the researchers collected materials from old kiln sites for chemical comparison with the ceramic bowls, which means that the researchers must have already known the location of those kiln sites. Rather than identifying the location of the kilns, the researchers determined which kilns in operation 1,000 years ago had likely produced the bowls that were found in the shipwreck.  Choice D is incorrect. Although the text says that using a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer tool enabled Niziolek and her team to analyze artifacts in the form of ceramic bowls without damaging them, the text doesn’t discuss how researchers analyzed artifacts before this tool was invented. Moreover, the point that the bowls were left undamaged isn’t the text’s main idea.

The last sentence of the text explains that historians of capitalism generally rely on a type of data that requires \"archival records, which do not exist for much of precolonial Africa.\" Nevertheless, Alfagali and other Africanist scholars have demonstrated that features of capitalism including \"returns-focused investment,...open markets for wage labor, and other features of capitalism\" existed in parts of Africa before colonization. Because archival records typically used by historians of capitalism aren′t available for precolonial Africa, Alfagali and other Africanist scholars of precolonial capitalism in Africa likely used atypical sources for their studies.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text states that archival records containing longitudinal economic data \"do not exist for much of precolonial Africa.\" If these records don’t exist for precolonial Africa, then Alfagali and other Africanist scholars couldn’t derive data from them by any method. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Alfagali and other Africanist scholars define capitalism differently than other historians of capitalism do. On the contrary, the text simply asserts that specific features they found, such as \"returns-focused investment [and] open markets for wage labor,\" are \"features of capitalism,\" which implies scholarly agreement that these activities are capitalist in nature. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate any effects of capitalism in Africa, positive or negative.

The text explains that the four inner planets, including Earth, formed from the innermost ring and that the remaining planets formed from the middle ring. It then explains that in one simulation, the researchers delayed the formation of the middle ring—that is, they tested to see what would happen if the middle ring had formed later than it actually did. They found that doing so affected the size of the innermost planets, resulting in oversized super-Earths, planets that are much larger than Earth. Since the delayed timing had the effect of changing the size of Earth in the simulation relative to Earth’s real size, it’s reasonable to conclude that the timing of the middle ring’s formation was important in determining Earth’s eventual size. \n\nChoice A is incorrect.

The text also indicates that maize originated in Mexico and spread northward into what is now the US Southwest—the area where the Uto-Aztecan language family originated. It follows, then, that the language family had already divided into northern and southern branches before maize reached that area; if maize had been present before the division occurred, the family’s origin language would have had terminology for it that likely would have been reflected in the branches, meaning they would have had similar vocabulary for maize. If maize arrived after the division occurred, however, the tribes in the two regions likely would have developed vocabulary pertaining to maize separately, at the times when they acquired the crop.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text focuses on vocabulary pertaining to maize in the branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family, and referring only to how some Uto-Aztecan tribes obtained maize wouldn’t directly address the role of language. Moreover, if northern Uto-Aztecan tribes had acquired maize from a southern Uto-Aztecan tribe, it’s reasonable to assume that the northern tribes might have also picked up southern Uto-Aztecan terminology for maize in that exchange. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the fact that the northern and southern branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family don’t have shared vocabulary pertaining to maize, not the idea that there are variations in such vocabulary within each branch—that is, the text focuses on differences between the two branches, not on differences between languages within a branch.

The values on the x-axis represent survey participants grouped by their own ignobility scores, from low ignobility (1) to high ignobility (7), while the values on the y-axis represent the likability scores given to the political candidates. The graph shows that the full range of participants (from least to most ignoble) gave the admirable-trait candidates (represented by the line with triangles) a likability rating of approximately 70 out of 100; that is, regardless of their own level of ignobility, participants generally found admirable-trait candidates quite likable. However, the graph shows that participants varied in their views of ignoble-trait candidates (represented by the line with squares); likability ratings increased as the participants’ own ignobility scores increased. Participants with low to medium-high ignobility scores (1 to 5) still rated the ignoble-trait candidates as less likable than the admirable-trait candidates, with all ratings falling below approximately 70, but participants with high ignobility scores (6 and 7) gave ratings equal to or higher than approximately 70. In other words, the previously observed trend of ranking admirable-trait candidates as more likable than ignoble-trait candidates persisted for participants with low to medium-high ignobility but not for participants with high ignobility.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it describes the opposite of what the graph shows. The graph shows a positive correlation between participants’ ignobility scores and ignoble-trait candidates’ likability ratings (as participants’ ignobility scores increased, so did their ratings for ignoble-trait candidates’ likability) and no correlation between ignobility scores and admirable-trait candidates’ likability ratings (all participants gave admirable-trait candidates a rating of approximately 70 out of 100). Choice C is incorrect. The graph does show that regardless of their own ignobility scores, participants rated admirable-trait candidates as quite likable (a rating of approximately 70 out of 100). However, this doesn’t support the researchers’ conclusion because the conclusion has to do with how participants rated both types of candidates, not just the admirable-trait ones; moreover, the conclusion is that relative ratings were actually affected by the participants’ ignobility scores. Choice D is incorrect. The graph does show that only participants with an ignobility score of 6 gave the same likability score to both admirable- and ignoble-trait candidates while participants with other ignobility scores gave a different rating for each candidate, but this doesn’t support the researchers’ conclusion. The conclusion isn’t just that participants gave different ratings to the two types of candidates—it’s that participants with low to medium-high ignobility scores specifically gave higher likability ratings to admirable-trait candidates than to ignoble-trait candidates and that participants with high ignobility scores didn’t.",

The text explains that economist Adam Smith’s famous metaphor of the invisible hand was putatively (that is, widely assumed but not proven) intended to illustrate a robust model (a consistently accurate generalization) of how individuals pursuing their own economic interests can create broader benefits for the population. The text then emphasizes the lack of affirmative evidence for this idea by calling out the term \"putatively,\" and explaining that, according to Gavin Kennedy, Smith used the metaphor only once in his works, in reference to specific circumstances related to the now-outdated economic view known as mercantilism, and that the metaphor didn’t garner much attention until economists in the twentieth century held it up as a paradigm (a theoretical framework in the field) and thereby implied that Smith shared some of their views on economics. By emphasizing \"putatively,\" the text implies that there is no independent reason to believe that Smith would agree with the metaphor’s use outside of the specific context for which he wrote it and that, therefore, the twentieth-century economists who used it did so to support their own views without regard for the metaphor’s importance to Smith’s work.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Smith’s metaphor was largely ignored until some twentieth-century economists revived it and bolstered its status, the text suggests that the later economists used Smith’s metaphor to self-servingly boost their own work while ignoring the original context in which Smith wrote it. Moreover, the statement in this choice fails to reflect the text’s emphasis on Smith’s limited use of the metaphor in his work. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that some twentieth-century economists altered the significance of Smith’s metaphor, the text doesn’t suggest that the metaphor is a \"useful model\" of how aggregate benefits arise from individuals’ selfish actions, let alone that this usefulness is unaffected by taking the metaphor out of its original context. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Smith’s metaphor was intended as a model of how individuals acting in their own interest produce aggregate benefits and it was written within the context of the now-outdated economic theory of mercantilism, these points are subordinate to the primary idea in the text, which is that Smith’s use of the metaphor was tightly constrained but twentieth-century economists ignored the original context so that they could use the metaphor to suggest, without support, that Smith would agree with their economic views.",

The text indicates that the roots of the two plant species grow directly into quartzite rock, where hairs on the roots secrete acids that dissolve the rock. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on this process because dissolving rock opens spaces for the roots to grow and releases phosphates that provide the plants with phosphorus, a vital nutrient. If the plants carry out this process of dissolving rock even when the rock already has spaces into which the roots could grow, that would support the researchers’ hypothesis because it suggests that the plants are getting some advantage—such as access to phosphorus—from the action of dissolving rock. If the plants don’t benefit from dissolving rock, they would be expected to grow in the cracks that already exist, as doing so would mean that the plants don’t have to spend energy creating and secreting acids; if, however, the plants create new entry points by dissolving rock even when cracks already exist, that would support the hypothesis that they depend on dissolving rock for some benefit.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the existence of soil-inhabiting members of the Velloziaceae family with similar root structures to those of the two species discussed in the text wouldn’t support the researchers’ hypothesis that the species discussed in the text depend on dissolving rock. If other such members exist, that might suggest that the root structures can serve more functions than secreting acids to dissolve rock (since dissolving rock may not be necessary for plants living in soil), but that wouldn’t suggest anything about whether the species discussed in the text benefit from dissolving rock. Choice B is incorrect because differences in the proportions of citric and malic acid secreted by the two species would be irrelevant to the hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock. There’s no information in the text to suggest that the proportion of each acid has any bearing on the process of dissolving rock or on any benefits the plants might receive from that process. Choice D is incorrect because if the two species thrive on rocks without phosphates, that would weaken the researchers’ hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock partly because dissolving rock gives them access to phosphates. If the plants can survive on rocks without getting a vital nutrient by dissolving those rocks, then either the nutrient isn’t actually vital for those plants or they can get the nutrient in some way other than by dissolving rocks.",

The text also indicates that around the same time, the sites began to contain glass beads and other artifacts seeming to be from the Near East, even though there is no evidence that the people of those sites traveled widely outside Siberia. Because there is evidence of Near East dog breeds and Near East artifacts at Siberian sites beginning about 2,000 years ago but no evidence of the people’s travel to the Near East around that time, it’s reasonable to infer that Feuerborn and colleagues concluded that dogs and artifacts like glass beads were transported to Siberia from the Near East, starting around 2,000 years ago.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text explicitly states that there is no evidence that the people of the Siberian sites 2,000 years ago traveled extensively beyond Siberia, which they would’ve had to do to reach the Near East; therefore, it wouldn’t make sense to conclude that the presence of Near East dog breeds and artifacts like glass beads suggests that people from Siberia began arriving in the Near East around 2,000 years ago.

Gayah’s claim that eliminating the option to turn left at busy intersections would improve traffic flow and reduce overall travel times. The text begins by describing a problem encountered by drivers in countries with right-hand traffic—namely that drivers wanting to make a left turn must wait for either gaps in oncoming traffic or for designated left-turn signals before proceeding. The resulting backup of vehicles causes increased traffic congestion at busy intersections that slows overall travel times. According to Gayah, eliminating left turns from busy intersections in urban areas would ease the congestion caused by vehicles waiting to turn left. If vehicles spend less time waiting at intersections for left turns, faster overall travel times would result even if some drivers would have to drive slightly longer distances to make the desired left turn. Drivers for package-delivery companies, who presumably spend most of the day driving to destinations across the city in which they are based, would likely provide a good indication of overall traffic patterns across the city. A finding that after a city had eliminated left turns at busy intersections, package-delivery companies were able to complete more daily deliveries on average—which implies faster travel times between package destinations—would therefore support the claim that overall travel times would decrease if left turns were eliminated at busy intersections.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because a finding that a majority of survey respondents agreed with the statement that implementing left-turn signals at all busy intersections made navigating streets in their communities easier wouldn’t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether at some busy intersections—both with and without dedicated left-turn signals—would improve the flow of traffic and overall traffic times. In fact, the text emphasizes that designated left-turn signals contribute to increased congestion because they require drivers to wait to turn left, which results in a backup of vehicles. Installing such signals at all busy intersections would thus potentially compound the problem of congestion, not improve it. Moreover, although making streets easier for drivers to navigate might indicate that left-turn signals are beneficial to drivers, it doesn’t indicate that overall travel times would necessarily be reduced. Choice B is incorrect because a study concluding that drivers wait longer to make left turns at intersections without dedicated left-turn signals than at intersections with such signals wouldn’t support the claim that eliminating the option to turn left altogether would reduce overall travel times. In fact, the finding would merely support the idea that installing left-turn signals would likely reduce the time drivers spend waiting at busy intersections that didn’t previously have left-turn signals, not that overall travel times would be reduced. Choice D is incorrect because the finding that after a restriction eliminating left turns at most intersections took effect, school buses took longer to complete their routes than they did before the restriction was implemented would contradict rather than support the researcher’s claim that eliminating left turns would reduce overall travel times.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a conclusion about the role of fynbos roots in maintaining the border with the Afro-temperate forest that can be reasonably inferred from the text. The text states that plants in the fynbos have \"uniquely thin and long root systems that spread out over large distances to absorb nutrients from the soil.\" The text then describes an experiment where forest tree seedlings grown in plots isolated from fynbos roots grew at a rate five times greater than seedlings in areas near fynbos roots. This strongly suggests that fynbos roots are depleting soil nutrients to such an extent that forest plants can’t get enough nutrients from that soil to flourish, thereby hindering the formation of any significant \"transition space\" between the habitats and helping keep the border between them sharp.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there is no evidence in the text that fynbos roots physically damage the root systems of forest plants. Instead, the text explicitly describes fynbos plants as having \"uniquely thin and long root systems that spread out over large distances to absorb nutrients from the soil.\" This description establishes that fynbos roots are specialized for efficient nutrient absorption. The experiment then confirms this function of the roots by showing that forest seedlings \"isolated from the roots of fynbos plants exhibited a growth rate five times greater\" than those near fynbos roots. This result demonstrates that when forest seedlings don’t have to compete with the nutrient-absorbing fynbos roots, they grow much better. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that the fynbos and the Afro-temperate forest are distinct from, and adjacent to, each other and that there is \"almost no transition space\" (area of mixed fynbos and forest plants), the experiment shows that forest plants can grow in soil occupied by fynbos roots, just not very well. So, the idea that the fynbos roots physically obstruct forest plants is unsupported by the text. Choice D is incorrect because it directly contradicts the text’s claim that fynbos roots absorb nutrients from, and therefore deplete, the soil they’re in, and furthermore, nothing in the text suggests that the habitat of the fynbos is harsh in general.",

The text goes on to say that recent genetic analysis has demonstrated that the modern turkey population in the Rio Grande Valley descends partly from the ancient turkeys raised at Mesa Verde, and that the genetic markers shared by the two turkey populations first appeared at Mesa Verde only after 1280 C.E.

However, Shultz and others have found that certain male tanagers can appear to have deeply saturated feathers even if they haven’t consumed a diet rich in carotenoids, thanks to microstructures in their feathers that manipulate light. If those birds aren’t necessarily eating carotenoid-rich diets, they may actually be less fit than other birds that appear to have similarly saturated feathers; this suggests that a male tanager’s appearance may function as a dishonest signal, or a false indication, of the bird’s overall fitness. \n\nChoice A is incorrect because Shultz’s finding suggests that some tanagers can signal fitness without consuming the carotenoids that contribute to fitness, thereby making those signals dishonest, not that tanagers can give honest signals of their fitness without consuming carotenoids. Choice B is incorrect because Shultz’s finding suggests that the microstructures in certain tanagers’ feathers can give a dishonest signal of fitness, not that the microstructures are less effective than actual pigmentation for signaling fitness. Whether the signal of fitness is honest or dishonest has no bearing on how effective the signal is: a signal is effective if potential mates behave as though it’s true, regardless of whether it’s actually true. Since there’s no information in the text about how potential mates respond to the dishonest signals of some tanagers, there’s no support for the idea that the dishonest signals are less effective than the honest signals. Choice C is incorrect because Shultz’s finding suggests that certain male tanagers may appear to be fitter than they actually are, not that scientists haven’t determined why tanagers prefer mates with colorful appearances.",

The text begins by discussing Waweru’s discovery of evidence that ancient versions of the board game mancala had been played at a site in the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. The evidence consisted of many rows of shallow pits carved into stone. The text goes on to state that some newer pits were carved on top of older pits, suggesting that people may have continued to play the game there over multiple generations, creating new pits over time. The text then explicitly states that the presence of newer pits carved on top of older pits was precisely what caused Waweru to think that mancala had been played at the site for a long time.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. While the text does state that Waweru \"noticed many rows of shallow pits carved into stone,\" this observation led her to believe that the pits could have been used as game boards for ancient versions of mancala but did not specifically suggest to her that the game had been played at the site for a long time. The multiple rows of pits merely suggest that these pits functioned as part of a game board; they don’t necessarily indicate how long the site had been used for that purpose. Rather, it was the fact that there appeared to be newer pits carved on top of older pits that led Waweru to think that mancala had been played at the site for a long time. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that Waweru found the pits at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, this isn’t the reason the text gives for why she thought that mancala had been played at the site for a long time. The location of the discovery only provides information about where the game was played, not how long the game had been played there. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any variation in the depth of the pits.

The table indicates that 61 million people in Tanzania, which amounts to 100 percent of the population, speak Swahili. If 61 million people in Tanzania speak Swahili, but only 15 million people worldwide have Swahili as their first language, that means there are many people in Tanzania who speak Swahili as a language other than their first language.

The text indicates that the more effective type of tool has a hook that the crows make themselves, while the other type of tool is simply a stick without a hook that the crows find and don’t shape in any way. According to the text, Klump found that the crows keep hooked tools—but not the tools without hooks—in their grasp or in safe places when they aren’t using the tools. If the hooked tools are more effective than the tools without hooks are and the crows are more protective of the hooked tools than they are of the tools without hooks, it’s reasonable to conclude that the hooked tools are more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of how easy it is for the crows to hold either the hooked tools or the tools without hooks. The text does state that crows hold the hooked tools and not the tools without hooks when the tools aren’t in use. However, the text also indicates that the hooked tools require work from the crows to make and are more useful for helping the crows catch prey than the tools without hooks are. This context suggests that the crows hold the hooked tools because they’re more valuable to the crows than the tools without hooks are, not because the hooked tools are easier to hold. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the crows sharing tools. Additionally, the text indicates that when the crows aren’t using the hooked tools, they either grasp the tools or store them safely, which suggests that the crows try to maintain possession of the hooked tools, not that crows prefer to share those tools. Choice D is incorrect because the text says nothing about the crows using their claws to remove prey from holes, so there’s no evidence that the crows perceive the stick tools to be less effective than their claws are.",

Thus, these data from the graph strongly support the conclusion that using nitrogen fertilizer increases cantaloupe yield.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the bar graph shows that in 2019 the nitrogen group had a yield below 30 pounds per acre.

Choice D is incorrect. Although it is true that the bar graph shows a higher yield for the nitrogen group in 2018 than in 2017, without the control to compare against, it is impossible to know whether the increase is due to the fertilizer and not, for example, more favorable weather in 2018 than in 2017.",

The graph shows mean ticket prices chosen by participants in response to three messages across two studies: Study 1, which the text indicates was conducted with an age-diverse group recruited online, and Study 2, which was conducted with student participants. The graph indicates that in the \"pay what you think it’s worth\" condition, the mean price of the concert tickets in Study 2 was about $74, which is greater than the mean price of about $55 in Study 1. In other words, when participants were asked to consider their valuation of the tickets, the response was heterogeneous, or mixed. Moreover, according to the graph, both Study 1 and Study 2 show higher prices for the tickets under the \"pay what you think it’s worth\" condition than they do under both the \"pay what you can\" and the \"pay what you want\" conditions. That is, the data suggest that both groups of participants named higher prices when considering the value of the tickets than when considering either what they could afford or wanted to pay, a finding that supports the idea that sellers can benefit when prompting consumers to consider their own valuations when they choose prices.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it contradicts information in the graph. Although the graph shows that students in Study 2 assigned a higher value to the tickets than did the age-diverse group in Study 1, which would support the idea that consumer valuations were heterogeneous, the graph shows that in the \"pay what you can\" (i.e., what you can afford) condition, the students in Study 2 assigned a higher price (about $40), not a lower price, than the age-diverse group in Study 1 did (about $30). Moreover, even if it were true that the students had assigned a lower price in this condition, it wouldn’t support the result described in the text, only that the participants across the two studies had different ideas of what they can afford to pay. Choice B is incorrect. Although a finding that participants tended to choose prices that were closest to the actual ticket costs in the \"pay what you think it’s worth\" condition would support the idea that sellers benefit by prompting consumers to think about their own valuations (since it’s implied that sellers would lose money in the other conditions, where chosen prices were lower than the participants’ valuations), neither the text nor the graph addresses how any of the prices chosen by the study participants relate to the tickets’ actual market price. Choice D is incorrect.

Yet the image on the gorget is of a jaguar—a species whose range doesn’t extend to Missouri. Jaguar images are common in ancient Mexican art, and Mexico lies squarely in the species’ range.

The text describes the Fairfield Gorget as one of the oldest examples of these necklaces, noting that it’s similar to other art from the Mississippian period except for its image of a jaguar. The text goes on to explain that this is unusual because the jaguar’s range didn’t include Missouri. The Fairfield Gorget’s artist likely wouldn’t have encountered a live jaguar, but since such jaguar images were common in ancient Mexican art (and the jaguar’s range did include Mexico), perhaps some of that art inspired the gorget’s artist. Therefore, evidence that an ancient Mexican art object had been found at a site that was close to the Fairfield Gorget in both location and time period would strongly support the explanation that long-distance trade from Mexico took place during the Mississippian period and that jaguar imagery could have reached Missouri by those means.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The underlined explanation indicates that Mexican artistic influence preceded the creation of the Fairfield Gorget. An artifact from Mexico that appeared in Missouri only after the gorget was created cannot support such a claim. Choice B is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to whether the jaguar image on the Fairfield Gorget was suggested to the Mississippian artist who made it by encounters with depictions of jaguars in Mexican art. The appearance of jaguars in Missouri after the Mississippian period cannot provide evidence for such a claim. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined explanation pertains to influence that Mexican art might have had on Mississippian art, restricted to the period from 900 CE to 1600 CE.

The text then highlights a research team’s discovery that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating a single odor receptor, Or31, that is shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. The text suggests that compared to the repellents mentioned earlier, a repellent that acts on the Or31 receptor would be more effective: by noting that all mosquito species known to carry diseases share the Or31 receptor, the text suggests that the Or31 receptor may be unique in this respect, meaning that a repellent such as EBF that acts on it would be more effective since it works on a single receptor shared by all mosquito species that carry diseases, rather than a combination of receptors that is not shared by all species. Once mosquitoes become resistant to EBF, it would therefore make sense for researchers to look for other molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors, since a single such component could also repel all disease-carrying mosquitoes.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that EBF molecules are difficult to extract from chrysanthemums and that investigating alternative extraction methods would therefore be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents.

Choice D is incorrect because it doesn’t logically follow that the discovery of one odor receptor shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes should lead to further research into which repellents might activate the greatest number of odor receptors.

The text indicates that researchers found that when A. ocellaris is exposed to low levels of ALAN, spawning frequency and egg fertilization aren’t significantly affected but hatching is completely inhibited—that is, the eggs never hatch. Therefore, if A. ocellaris were to settle only in regions where the fish would be regularly exposed to low levels of ALAN, their eggs would stop hatching and their reproductive success would be at risk.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that exposure to low levels of ALAN had no significant effect on egg fertilization for A. ocellaris, so there’s no reason to expect there would be any significant difference in rates of successful egg fertilization between areas with low levels of ALAN and areas without ALAN. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss the particular effects of low levels of ALAN on any species of coral reef fish besides A. ocellaris. For this reason, there’s no support in the text for the idea that the reproductive success of A. ocellaris is more greatly affected by the presence of low levels of ALAN than the reproductive success of other species of coral reef fish is. Choice D is incorrect. The text does indicate that A. ocellaris incubation was most strongly affected by low levels of ALAN, but it doesn’t indicate that there was a greater effect on spawning frequency than on egg fertilization; in fact, the text states that there was no significant effect on either.",

Karla A. Camacho-Cruz and colleagues assessed delta 15-N values in the seagrass Thalassia testudinum from sites on Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula with intermediate tourism development, including Akumal Bay and Tulum, and low tourism development, including Mahahual and Xahuayxol, throughout 2016 and 2017.

    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it describes data from the table that support the underlined conclusion. The text accompanying the table states that delta 15-N values (a measure of the ratio of two nitrogen isotopes) can be used as an indirect means of measuring the ratio of human wastewater to water from uncontaminated sources—the higher the delta 15-N values, the greater the presence of human wastewater. The text goes on to mention an experiment conducted by Camacho-Cruz and colleagues measuring delta 15-N values in seagrass on the Yucatan peninsula at several sites, four of which are presented in the table accompanying the text. Two of the sites noted in the table, Akumal Bay and Tulum, had intermediate tourism development, and two others, Mahahual and Xahuayxol, had low tourism development. It is reasonable to infer that sites with intermediate tourism have a greater human presence than those with low tourism and therefore are subject to greater amounts of wastewater and exhibit higher delta 15-N values in seagrass. However, Camacho-Cruz and colleagues found that the increase in delta 15-N values was not constant. The table supports this conclusion because the two intermediate-tourism sites (Akumal Bay and Tulum) had delta 15-N values that fluctuated considerably—both had higher delta 15-N values than the two low-tourism sites (Mahahual and Xahuayxol) in October 2016 and October 2017, but in February 2017 the delta 15-N values for the intermediate-tourism sites dropped significantly (in fact, Mahahual, a low-tourism site, had a higher delta 15-N value for that period). The fluctuations in values in Akumal Bay and Tulum support the conclusion that these sites experienced influxes of human wastewater intermittently.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table: in February 2017 the delta 15-N value in Akumal Bay was higher than the delta 15-N value in Xahuayxol, not lower. Choice B is incorrect because the absence of data for delta 15-N levels in Akumal Bay in February 2016 would neither prove nor disprove that the presence of human wastewater at Akumal Bay and Tulum was not constant. Despite the unavailable data, there is still enough information to conclude that delta 15-N levels at both sites fluctuated significantly and that influxes of human wastewater therefore happened intermittently. Choice C is incorrect because a constancy in delta 15-N values would not indicate that the influx of human wastewater was intermittent, but rather the opposite. Moreover, the two periods selected are not indicative of general trends in the whole table (for example, the values fluctuated significantly in Akumal Bay between February 2017 and October 2017, and in Tulum between October 2016 and February 2017).",

The text indicates that Miranda-Pérez and her team found that adding a layer of perovskite to silicon-based cells increased the percentage of sunlight converted to usable electricity relative to the percentage converted to electricity by silicon-based cells. Using cells with only perovskite and no silicon, however, resulted in no improvement in efficiency over silicon-based cells. The text also states that perovskite captures light in the blue range of the solar spectrum and silicon captures light in the red range of the spectrum. If perovskite and silicon capture different parts of the solar spectrum and the combination of perovskite and silicon results in greater efficiency than the use of either perovskite or silicon alone does, then it is reasonable to infer that the improved efficiency of perovskite-silicon cells could be attributable to their making use of more of the solar spectrum than perovskite-based or silicon-based cells do.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because it is directly contradicted by the text, which says that silicon-based cells convert 18%–22% of the sunlight that reaches them to electricity and that cells with only perovskite are no more efficient than silicon-based cells are. Perovskite-only cells thus must convert 22% or less—not more than 29.5%—of the sunlight that reaches them to electricity. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on a possible improvement to photovoltaic cells and makes no mention of any alternatives to those cells, so there is no reason to conclude that photovoltaic cells must be replaced with some other technology. Additionally, the text presents solar power as something that currently exists, so it wouldn’t make sense to conclude that solar power will remain elusive. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of other minerals than perovskite. In fact, the text gives no indication that it is even possible to use other minerals than silicon and perovskite in photovoltaic cells.

The text explains that for many trees, counting the dark rings visible in a tree stump is a reliable method for determining the tree’s age. However, if olive trees have growth rings that are difficult to see, it would be hard to count the individual rings. Therefore, the ring-counting method would be challenging or impossible to use for olive trees. This directly supports the researcher’s claim that the ring-counting method often can’t be used for olive trees because it identifies a specific characteristic of olive trees that could render this approach impracticable.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the probable age of the oldest olive tree doesn’t explain why counting rings wouldn’t work for determining olive tree age. The older age of some olive trees might make counting more tedious but doesn’t pose an insurmountable obstacle to adopting the method. The researcher’s claim is about the feasibility of the ring-counting method for olive trees, not about the potential impracticality of employing this method for particularly long-lived trees. Choice B is incorrect because the fact that narrow growth rings might indicate harsh growing conditions has no direct bearing on the claim that counting rings often can’t be used to determine olive tree age. It is possible that growth rings that are too narrowly spaced might be difficult to count, but the researcher’s claim relates to the inapplicability of the ring-counting method to olive trees in general rather than to olive trees that have experienced harsh conditions. Moreover, as long as they are visible, even narrow growth rings might permit the ring-counting method to be used to determine tree age. Choice D is incorrect because the ideal climate conditions for olive trees don’t explain why counting rings wouldn’t work as a method for determining their age.

The program captured some condors in 1987 in order to breed them and has been reintroducing captive birds into the wild since 1992. Many biologists claim the program has been a success, as the text explains, and it is reasonable to infer that an indication of the program’s success would be an increase in the wild condor population compared to the captive condor population. The graph shows the wild and captive condor populations in California between 2014 and 2020. In 2014 there were slightly more than 200 wild condors in California, but by 2020 there were more than 300. Meanwhile, over the same period the captive condor population remained under 200.

According to the text, the researchers’ study design included a group of employees who took no leave, a group who took 2–4 days of leave, and a group who took 1–5 weeks of leave. The participants who took leave were tested for attentiveness one week before their leave (the first test administration), one week after their return to work (the second test administration), and two weeks after their return (the third test administration). The participants who took no leave were tested three times at random. The graph shows that at one week after their return to work, participants who took only 2–4 days of leave had an average attentiveness score of between 540 and 600, while participants who took 1–5 weeks of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540. At two weeks after their return to work, those who took only 2–4 days of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540, while those who took 1–5 weeks of leave had an average score of approximately 480. In other words, the graph shows that on both post-leave testing dates, participants with longer leave times had lower average attentiveness scores than those with shorter leave times. Since attentiveness is an indicator of cognitive functioning, these data confirm Packer and colleagues’ conclusion that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The graph does show that in the second test administration, participants who took 2–4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave and also shows that in the third test administration, those who took no leave had higher average scores than those who took 1–5 weeks of leave. But neither of these findings has a direct bearing on the researchers’ conclusion, which concerns a comparison of participants who took 2–4 days of leave with those who took 1–5 weeks, rather than a comparison of either group with participants who took no leave. Choice B is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the first test administration, participants who took 2–4 days of leave had lower average attentiveness scores than did those who took 1–5 weeks of leave and those who took no leave, this test administration occurred before any participants went on leave; therefore, these results have no bearing on the researchers’ conclusion about how the amount of leave taken by participants affected their cognitive functioning. Choice D is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2–4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave, the researchers’ conclusion is about the effects of short leave compared with the effects of long leave, not the effects of short leave compared with the effects of no leave.

Often a hibernating animal will temporarily come out of torpor (called an arousal episode) and its metabolic rate will rise, burning more of the precious energy the animal needs to survive the winter. Alaska marmots hibernate in groups and therefore burn less energy keeping warm during these episodes than they would if they were alone.

The table shows data about torpor bouts and arousal episodes for the two species from 2008 to 2011. According to the table, the average duration of torpor bouts was 13.81 days for Alaska marmots, shorter than the average of 16.77 days for Arctic ground squirrels, and the average duration of arousal episodes was 21.2 hours for Alaska marmots, longer than the average of 14.2 hours for Arctic ground squirrels. Thus, the table supports the researcher’s hypothesis by showing that Alaska marmots had shorter bouts of torpor and longer arousal episodes than Arctic ground squirrels did.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table and doesn’t support the researcher’s hypothesis. The table shows that the average duration of arousal episodes was less than a day for both Alaska marmots (21.2 hours) and Arctic ground squirrels (14.2 hours). Additionally, information about arousal episodes for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels isn’t sufficient to support a hypothesis involving comparisons of both arousal episodes and torpor bouts for those animals. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t support the researcher’s hypothesis, which involves comparisons of arousal episodes as well as torpor bouts for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels. Noting that both animals had torpor bouts lasting several days, on average, doesn’t address arousal episodes at all, nor does it reveal how the animals’ torpor bouts compared. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn’t support the researcher’s hypothesis.

    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it describes an experimental outcome that would most directly weaken the student’s hypothesis. According to the text, the student hypothesizes that Brassica rapa parachinensis (choy sum) will benefit more from acidic soil than it will from neutral soil. The text then explains that the student planted 16 choy sum seeds in potting soil with coffee grounds added to increase acidity and another 16 seeds in soil without coffee grounds as a control (a group identical to the experimental group except for the experimental modification being tested). If the hypothesis were correct, the plants in the more acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture would grow faster than those in the control group. However, choice A proposes a scenario in which the plants in soil without coffee grounds were “significantly taller” than those in the more acidic mixture—an outcome that weakens the hypothesis that higher acidity is beneficial to the plants’ growth.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. If the choy sum planted in the neutral soil produced less plant matter and therefore weighed less than the choy sum planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture, this finding would strengthen the student’s hypothesis, not weaken it. Choice C is incorrect. If seeds planted in neutral soil (without coffee grounds) sprouted significantly later than seeds planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture, this finding would strengthen, not weaken, the student’s hypothesis that acidic soil benefits choy sum. Choice D is incorrect. If seeds planted in the neutral soil (without coffee grounds) sprouted significantly fewer plants than seeds planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture did, this finding would strengthen, not weaken, the student’s hypothesis that choy sum benefits from acidic soil.",

    "prompt_text": "Initially observed in 2017, the interstellar object ‘Oumuamua is the first object of its kind to be seen in our solar system. Researchers have been puzzled because its acceleration cannot be entirely explained by the gravitational pull of nearby bodies: there must be a nongravitational influence on its velocity and trajectory. Some previously suggested explanations for this nongravitational acceleration involve mechanisms that are unlikely or unrealistic, such as geometric effects from ‘Oumuamua being potentially composed of several spatially separated bodies. Now, Jennifer Bergner and colleagues propose that the nongravitational acceleration is due to the gaseous expulsion of entrapped hydrogen from ‘Oumuamua’s water-rich icy body.",

      "Since nongravitational accelerations of interstellar objects are several orders of magnitude weaker than gravitational accelerations, deviation from behavior that could be fully attributed to gravitational pull has been detected on a limited number of objects similar to ‘Oumuamua.",

    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents findings that, if true, would support the claim made by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of ‘Oumuamua is due to the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen. The text first introduces the observation of a unique interstellar object named ‘Oumuamua and goes on to explain that the object exhibited nongravitational acceleration that could not be fully attributed to the expected cause: gravitational pull of nearby celestial bodies. The text concludes by stating that Bergner and colleagues claim that the nongravitational acceleration is caused by expulsion of hydrogen gas from ‘Oumuamua’s water-rich icy body. To support this claim requires evidence that hydrogen gas could be present within ‘Oumuamua at all, which this answer choice presents: cosmic radiation can result in embedded pockets of hydrogen gas in water ice. Additionally, evidence that this gas can be released from such a body is required to fully support the claim, which this answer choice goes on to provide: ‘Oumuamua experienced sufficient warming as it traveled through the solar system to alter its icy structure and release the hydrogen gas. Thus, this answer choice provides the best evidence to support Bergner and colleagues’ claim.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because this answer choice concerns faults with previous models of outgassing from ‘Oumuamua of carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which would not support a claim regarding hydrogen outgassing. Furthermore, inconsistencies in other models would not provide evidence in support of a different model or explanation. Choice B is incorrect. The evidence presented in this answer choice would weaken the claim proposed by Bergner and colleagues that the nongravitational acceleration of ‘Oumuamua is caused by the expulsion of hydrogen gas because this answer choice suggests that there is evidence that refutes this claim: ‘Oumuamua’s trajectory is inconsistent with a nongravitational acceleration caused by the release of hydrogen gas. Furthermore, the remaining portion of this answer choice is unrelated to the claim. Choice C is incorrect because the claim being made by Bergner and colleagues concerns the expulsion of entrapped hydrogen gas, but this answer choice is concerned solely with the differences in magnitude of gravitational and nongravitational acceleration, which would not support Bergner’s claim. Furthermore, this answer choice discusses interstellar objects similar to ‘Oumuamua, but the text states that ‘Oumuamua is the first observed object of its kind in our solar system, so evidence from other, similar bodies would not be available.",

Aristotle observes that different forms of government can fall in different ways—for example, oligarchies might grant power to military leaders during wartime who refuse to relinquish that power during peacetime—but some methods of preserving order apply across all forms of government.

      "“When contrasting different forms of government, Aristotle holds that ‘oligarchies may last, not from any inherent stability in such forms of government, but because the rulers are on good terms both with the unenfranchised and with the governing classes.’ That is, oligarchic leaders who wish to hold on to power will introduce members of disenfranchised classes into government in a participatory role.”"

The philosopher states that when Aristotle builds his argument about the characteristics of a well-functioning government, Aristotle asserts that transgression, or violation of law, will ruin the state if it \"creeps in unperceived,\" or goes unnoticed. The philosopher then adds that Aristotle illustrates this point by comparing the situation to one in which small but frequent expenses diminish a fortune almost unnoticeably until, eventually, the fortune is entirely gone. In other words, the philosopher indicates that Aristotle makes the point that total obedience to law preserves a healthy state while even small violations, if ignored, will undermine the health of the state.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the philosopher addresses Aristotle’s observation about corruption within the government (in particular, preventing the possibility that members of the government can take bribes), and although corruption can involve infractions, the observation is about a subset of people within the state and isn’t directly connected to the importance of upholding total obedience to the law throughout the state. Choice C is incorrect because the philosopher discusses Aristotle’s point about those who would intentionally destroy a constitution altogether and the need for rulers to remind the populace that it would be dangerous for a constitution to collapse, but neither idea is directly connected to the importance of upholding total obedience to the law. Choice D is incorrect because the philosopher explains that Aristotle makes the point that oligarchic leaders may retain power by having members of disenfranchised classes participate in government alongside governing classes, and this point doesn’t address the importance of ensuring obedience to the law and addressing even minor violations.",

The text explicitly states that this feature of Hevea brasiliensis is \"helpful for the process of making rubber.\"\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention the quality of the rubber produced from the latex of Hevea brasiliensis or compare its quality to that of rubber produced from other sources. Choice C is incorrect because the text never discusses the climates in which Hevea brasiliensis grows. Moreover, the text mentions only one region where this tree is found: the Amazon rainforest. Choice D is incorrect. Because the text states that Hevea brasiliensis is the world’s \"main source of natural rubber,\" it can be inferred that there is at least one other source.

The researchers calculated that if individual plants were randomly distributed on this particular landscape, only about 15% would be with other plants in patches of vegetation. They counted the number of juvenile plants of five species growing in patches of vegetation and the number growing alone on bare ground and compared those numbers to what would be expected if the plants were randomly distributed. Based on these results, they claim that plants of these species that grow in close proximity to other plants gain an advantage at an early developmental stage.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it provides the most direct support from the table for the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. The table shows the total number of juvenile plants from five species that were found growing on bare ground and in patches of vegetation as well as the percentage of the total number of each species that were growing in patches of vegetation. For each of the five species, more than 50% of the juvenile plants were growing in patches of vegetation. The text notes, however, that a random distribution of plants across the landscape should result in only about 15% of the plants being found in patches of vegetation. In other words, for each of the five species, the percentage of juvenile plants found growing in patches of vegetation was substantially higher than could be explained by chance alone. This finding supports the claim in the text: if plants growing in patches are overrepresented among plants that have survived to the juvenile stage, as the data show they are, then it suggests that it’s advantageous for plants at an early stage of development to grow in patches of vegetation.  \n\nChoice A is incorrect because the statement that less than 75% of juvenile plants were found growing in patches of vegetation, while true, doesn’t clearly support the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. Saying that less than 75% of plants were found in patches doesn’t indicate how the percentage growing in patches compares with the percentage that would be expected to grow in patches on the basis of chance alone, which is the information necessary to evaluate whether the claim in the text has support in the table. Put another way, if the percentage of plants found growing in patches was 15% or less, it would be true that less than 75% were found in patches, but the data would in fact weaken the claim in the text, not strengthen it, since the data would show that growing in patches wasn’t advantageous. Choice B is incorrect because only 12 plants of this species were found growing in patches, which was the lowest number of any species, not the greatest number. Additionally, even if it were true that this species had the greatest number of plants growing in patches, the finding would be irrelevant to the claim that plants of all five species gained an advantage by growing in close proximity to other plants. Choice C is incorrect because 59.1% of the plants of these species were found growing in patches, which is a far greater percentage, not a lower percentage, than what would be expected if plants were randomly distributed (around 15%). Additionally, if it were true that the percentage of plants growing in patches was lower for these species than what would be expected from chance alone, that finding would weaken, not strengthen, the claim that growing in patches is advantageous.",

The implication is that some poems were composed before the invasion but the references to Spanish customs could have come about only after the invasion, and thus that the collection includes content that predates the invasion and also content from after the invasion.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text clearly indicates that the collection is in Nahuatl, not Spanish, so the compilers’ unfamiliarity with Spanish is irrelevant to whether the collection contains material composed after the Spanish invasion. Choice C is incorrect because the text mentions only the Aztec Empire and Spain: there is no information about the relationship of Aztec literature to any traditions other than its own or Spain’s. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that some of the poems make “inarguable references” to common Spanish customs, which conflicts with the idea that these references can reasonably be attributed to mere coincidence.",

The text explains that although synthetic aptamer molecules can be used to test for foodborne bacterial pathogens because they bind to target molecules, it hasn’t been clear how likely it is that they will indicate a negative result when a target pathogen is absent in real-world foods. The text then indicates that Somvanshi et al. created test paper that changes from pink to purple when aptamers in it bind to a particular strain of E. coli bacteria, O157:H7, and tested it with store-bought pear juice (that is, a real-world food); the paper changed to purple when exposed to juice to which the target pathogen E. coli O157:H7 had been added, but it remained pink when exposed to juice treated with other E. coli strains or other bacteria species. Based on this result, it seems the aptamers in the paper successfully bound to the target (O157:H7) and the tests had a high degree of specificity (providing negative results for samples where the target was absent even though other bacteria were present) when applied to a real-world food.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that E. coli O157:H7 differs from other pathogens in a way that makes it more suitable for aptamer-based testing of any kind and that specificity is likely to be lower when aptamer-based tests target other bacteria; the text simply indicates that Somvanshi et al. used O157:H7 as the target for aptamer-based test paper in their study and suggests that the paper had a high degree of specificity. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the specificity of aptamer-based tests in real-world foods is uncertain for pathogens broadly, not just for E. coli, and similarity between strains (of E. coli or of other pathogens) isn’t mentioned. Moreover, the results presented in the text suggest that aptamers are actually capable of distinguishing between strains of E. coli, since Somvanshi et al.’s paper turned purple when exposed to E. coli O157:H7 and remained pink when exposed to other strains. Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that the aptamers in the test papers didn’t bind to different strains of E. coli. The text explains that the test papers turn purple when the aptamers bind to the targeted pathogen and that in the pear juice tests, the test papers turned purple when exposed to samples with the targeted strain of E. coli (O157:H7) but remained pink when exposed to samples with other strains of E. coli. In other words, the aptamers bound only to the targeted strain, not to the other strains.

It’s logical to suggest that if the tusk serves such an important purpose for narwhals, the trait would be more common among them—specifically, that more narwhals would have a tusk.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there’s no reason to think Laidre would say that if the tusk has the important function of helping narwhals detect when the water around them is about to freeze (meaning that it isn’t always freezing), some narwhals would choose a different habitat altogether. Indeed, if it’s true that the tusk helps narwhals avoid areas with dangerous conditions when they occur in their Arctic Ocean habitat, the tusk would likely enable the narwhals to continue living in that habitat rather than drive them elsewhere entirely. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses only on narwhals and makes no mention of other marine animals or how having a tusk might affect them. And if anything, it would be more logical to expect a very important trait to be more widespread, not less common, among other similar types of animals. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text describes narwhals as shy, it doesn’t indicate that the scientists’ conclusion has anything to do with shyness.

    "prompt_text": "Approximate Rates of Speech and Information Conveyed for Five Languages\n\nA group of researchers working in Europe, Asia, and Oceania conducted a study to determine how quickly different Eurasian languages are typically spoken (in syllables per second) and how much information they can effectively convey (in bits per second). They found that, although languages vary widely in the speed at which they are spoken, the amount of information languages can effectively convey tends to vary much less. Thus, they claim that two languages with very different spoken rates can nonetheless convey the same amount of information in a given amount of time.",

    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it provides the most direct support from the table for the claim that two languages can convey similar amounts of information even if they’re spoken at different rates. The table shows the approximate rates at which five languages are spoken and the rates at which those five languages convey information. Vietnamese is spoken at around 5.3 syllables per second, whereas Spanish is spoken at around 7.7 syllables per second, but the two languages convey information at very similar rates: Vietnamese at a rate of around 42.5 bits per second and Spanish at a rate of around 42.0 bits per second. Thus, the description of Vietnamese conveying information at around the same rate that Spanish does despite being spoken more slowly supports the claim in the text that languages can convey the same amount of information even if spoken at different rates. \n\nChoice A is incorrect because it isn’t true that Thai and Hungarian have the lowest rates of speech of the five languages shown. According to the table, Hungarian is spoken at around 5.9 syllables per second, which is faster than Vietnamese (5.3 syllables per second). Additionally, even if this statement were true, the assertion that two languages are spoken the slowest and convey information the slowest wouldn’t support the claim that languages can convey the same amount of information even if they’re spoken at different rates. Choice C is incorrect because it isn’t true that the fastest-spoken language (Spanish, at 7.7 syllables per second) also conveys information the fastest: Spanish conveys information at 42.0 bits per second, which is slower than the 42.5 bits-per-second rate at which Vietnamese conveys information. Additionally, even if this statement were true, the assertion that the language spoken the fastest also conveys information the fastest has no bearing on the claim that languages can convey the same amount of information even if they’re spoken at different rates. Choice D is incorrect because it isn’t true that Serbian conveys information faster than Spanish does. According to the table, Serbian conveys information at a rate of around 39.1 bits per second, which is slower than the 42.0 bits-per-second rate at which Spanish conveys information.",

This critic challenges the claim by arguing that A History of Mexico is not so idiosyncratic (unique) as to resist classification because its use of Maya-style human profiles actually “invites classification as Indigenous art.” Therefore, according to this critic, the work can be viewed, at least partially, through a lens of national or cultural identity.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. While it describes the Maya influence on a particular aspect of A History of Mexico, this quotation doesn’t push back on Medellín’s “idiosyncratic” (unique) style, nor does it try to categorize the entire work into a single cultural tradition. Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t directly challenge the underlined claim, but rather supports it. It suggests that the work effectively blends a variety of artistic products to create a single work that can’t be defined by any one tradition. Instead, the work recalls many centuries of history and culture all at once. Choice C is incorrect. This choice supports rather than challenges the underlined claim. The quotation argues that other critics focus too much on Indigenous influences on the artwork instead of viewing all of the influences equally—that they should instead be viewing the work as an idiosyncratic whole instead of through one or two narrow cultural lenses.",

In the quotation, Du Bois explains that for his entire life, Black folk songs “stirred [him] strangely.” Even though they originated in the South, a region he wasn’t familiar with, he knew the songs “as of me and of mine.” That is, he identified strongly with them and associated them with his community. Therefore, Du Bois felt an intuitive sense of cultural recognition when he heard Black folk songs. \n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the quotation considers the cultural and spiritual value of Black folk music, it doesn’t establish that this music inspired in Du Bois a sense of cultural recognition. Choice C is incorrect because this quotation addresses the cultural survival of Black folk songs despite attempts to caricature, or parody, them, not Du Bois’s sense of cultural connection to them. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation indicates that the Black folk songs and music are old, “the siftings of centuries,” instead of addressing how Du Bois felt when he heard the songs.",

Researchers tested D. melanogaster’s resistance to P. rettgeri and A. sicerae bacteria based on which variation of the peptide-encoding gene the flies exhibit: DptA silenced (referred to as type A), DptB silenced (type B), or both silenced (type AB). The text also indicates that resistance to P. rettgeri correlates with DptA activity but not with DptB activity (which would manifest as type B flies surviving at a higher rate than other fly types when exposed to P. rettgeri). The graph shows the post–A. sicerae infection results, which indicate that DptB activity was most strongly associated with survival, whereas DptA activity was not (manifesting in the graph as the type A flies having greater survival rates than the other fly types). In other words, when DptA activity was silenced, the flies showed relatively high survival rates, but when DptB activity was silenced, whether on its own or in conjunction with DptA activity being silenced, survival rates were low, suggesting that DptB may have developed as a specific defense against A. sicerae.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The graph suggests that DptA activity is associated with a low rate of survival, not a high one. Furthermore, the graph shows results for flies where DptA alone was silenced, DptB alone was silenced, and both were silenced and thus does not show any flies with activity in both DptA and DptB, which would be necessary to determine whether DptA conferred defense against A. sicerae in the presence of DptB. Choice B is incorrect. Only two bacteria species were considered in the text: P. rettgeri and A. sicerae. The text and graph taken together suggest that activity in DptA is associated with resistance to P. rettgeri while DptB activity is not, and that DptB activity is associated with resistance to A. sicerae while DptA is not. There is no further information to suggest one genetic type confers resistance to a greater number of pathogens than the other. Choice D is incorrect. The graph does not address flies with activity in both DptA and DptB. All flies represented in the graph had one or both of DptA and DptB silenced, or inactive.",

The text then states that the results of an experiment specifically using the contexts of an inexpensive store (Forever 21) and an upscale one (Tiffany & Co.) suggest that an inexpensive store context may moderate, or lessen, that effect. If Sevilla and Townsend found that participants in the experiment with Tiffany & Co. and Forever 21 judged the same jewelry items as substantially more valuable when there was lots of space between them than when there was little space between them in the upscale store (Tiffany & Co.) but judged the same jewelry items as only slightly more valuable when there was lots of space between them than when there was little space between them in the inexpensive store (Forever 21), that finding would demonstrate that increased space between products was associated with less of an increase in those products’ perceived value at the inexpensive store than at the upscale store. Thus, the finding would support the text’s conclusion that a store context associated with inexpensive goods moderates the effect Sevilla and Townsend observed in their earlier experiments.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because if Sevilla and Townsend found that at both upscale and inexpensive stores, participants judged jewelry spaced far apart to be less valuable than jewelry spaced close together, that would show the opposite of the effect the researchers observed in their earlier experiments, not show that an inexpensive store context merely moderates, or lessens, that effect.

The text then highlights an instance in which Western scrub-jays were studied in both settings but with conflicting results, indicating that one or both studies may have failed to account for the disadvantages of its research setting. Thus, the main idea of the text is that while wild animals can be effectively studied in natural or lab settings, there are drawbacks to each that need to be considered to ensure accurate results.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text does not position one study setting (natural or lab) as superior to the other; rather, the text states that each one has advantages over the other. Choice B is incorrect. The text provides a hypothetical example of two studies in different environments with conflicting results, but this single example cannot be extrapolated to a general claim about the likelihood that results of studies in different environments will conflict. Additionally, the text does not assert anything about how researchers can or cannot resolve conflicting study results. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not state that discrepancies between natural-habitat and lab-based animal behavior studies are due to both of the designs being flawed. Rather, the text states that the conflict in results can be the consequence of one or both of the studies having failed to account for some factor.",

In this quotation, the speaker notes that as years go by, “Each, coming”—that is, each new year as it comes—“brings ambitions high.” In other words, the speaker begins each new year with large goals. But the speaker goes on to say that as each year ends (“each, departing”), it “leaves a sigh / Linked to the past.” A sigh is an expression of longing or regret, so in the context of the whole quotation, this portion suggests that at the end of each year, the speaker regretfully reflects on not having achieved the ambitions formed at the beginning of the year. The phrases “the years go swiftly by,” “Each, coming,” and “each, departing” indicate that this experience happens over and over again: the speaker experiences a cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. \n\nChoice A is incorrect because this quotation does not describe an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regretful reflection. Instead, the speaker describes experiencing a sensation similar to fright as a result of something that has occurred at midnight. Specifically, the speaker has heard a “brazen tongue,” a figurative way of saying that the speaker has heard the clang of a bronze bell being rung. Choice B is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of anticipation through its reference to “ominous stillness,” there is no suggestion of regretful reflection or any indication that the speaker is describing an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by such reflection. Instead, the speaker is describing a particular moment when a winter storm appears to have momentarily calmed. Choice C is incorrect because although this quotation does convey a sense of regret (“many a squandered day”), nothing in the quotation suggests an ongoing cycle of anticipation followed by regret.

The text explains that Morrison was the first Black woman to be an editor for Random House and that she was an editor there from 1967 to 1983. If it were true that Random House published a higher percentage of works by Black authors throughout the 1970s—during most of Morrison’s time working there—than it had previously published, that would suggest that Morrison may have made a deliberate effort to strengthen the presence of Black authors on the list of Random House’s published authors, thus supporting the scholar’s claim.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the scholar’s claim is about Morrison’s work as an editor at a publishing company and her likely effort to strengthen the presence of Black writers on that company’s list of published authors. It might be true that Black authors interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s often cited Morrison’s novels as an influence on their work, but that finding would simply suggest something about how those authors approached their work; it wouldn’t show that Morrison intended to increase the number of Black writers among the published authors specifically at Random House. Choice C is incorrect because the scholar’s claim is about Morrison’s work as an editor at a publishing company, not about her work as a novelist. Therefore, a finding that Morrison’s novels published after 1983 sold more copies and were more widely acclaimed than her earlier novels would have no bearing on the claim that as an editor Morrison made an effort to ensure that more Black writers were present on Random House’s list of published authors. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text discusses Morrison’s work as an editor at Random House, the scholar’s claim focuses on Morrison’s likely effort in that role to increase the number of Black writers present on Random House’s list of published authors, not on the influence she may have had on the content of the works she edited. Without knowing whether Morrison’s stylistic influence led to more publications or if Morrison applied her influence specifically to works by Black writers, the finding that works edited by Morrison could be identified by stylistic characteristics would have no bearing on the claim that Morrison intended to strengthen the presence of Black writers among the published authors at Random House.",

The text indicates that Kilburn-Toppin characterizes craft guild members as people who made and consumed items and were \"highly discerning,\" or were careful judges of quality. Because gift giving benefited one’s status and if craft guild members were particularly attentive to quality, it follows that gifting handmade items within the guilds—between people who had high standards for items they made and for items they received—may have been a way for members to maintain and enhance their professional reputations, or their professional statuses, among their peers.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes the idea that members of guilds participated in gift giving both to display and receive social status, suggesting that the gifting of handmade items between the \"highly discerning\" members of craft guilds had to do with the members’ interest in quality and status; nothing in the text suggests that the practice of gifting those items within the craft guilds was intended to limit knowledge of materials and techniques to the members of those guilds.

Borrowers use their business proceeds to repay loans in equal weekly installments and incur no penalty for missed payments other than lack of access to larger loans. Economists Gustavo Barboza and Sandra Trejos analyzed ALSOL data and found that rural borrowers, who mostly make and sell handicrafts, miss payments more often than urban borrowers do, partly because they sell their goods less frequently than they could.

The text explains that borrowers in the ALSOL program use proceeds from their businesses to repay loans in equal weekly payments, with almost no penalty for missed payments. According to the text, Barboza and Trejos found that rural borrowers miss weekly payments in part because they don’t sell their goods as often as they could, a move the researchers claim allows the entrepreneurs to help increase profits for the goods they sell. Finding that the cost of bringing goods to towns with marketplaces is high for rural entrepreneurs but is largely independent of how many goods are brought would support the researchers’ claim: traveling to marketplaces less frequently would mean that a rural entrepreneur spends less on travel overall, and taking a large load of goods to a marketplace for essentially the same cost as taking a small load would allow the entrepreneur to more substantially offset the cost of travel with greater overall sales at the marketplace, resulting in more profit per good sold—even if those profits are earned less frequently and don’t support weekly loan payments.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the finding that many marketplaces require entrepreneurs to pay the operators of the marketplace a fixed percentage of proceeds to be able to sell goods there wouldn’t explain why rural entrepreneurs strategically choose to sell their goods less frequently than they could in order to increase their profits per unit sold. With a fixed percentage of proceeds due to operators, the amount entrepreneurs have to pay operators would also be fixed regardless of frequency of selling. Choice B is incorrect because the finding that rural entrepreneurs can usually sell their goods for higher prices in cities than in their local areas but also face higher competition to sell goods in cities wouldn’t explain why rural entrepreneurs strategically choose to sell their goods less frequently than they could in order to increase their profits per unit sold. This is because both the higher prices and higher competition in cities would be stable factors—meaning there would be no clear reason for the rural entrepreneurs not to take every available chance to sell their goods in cities and to instead sell their goods in cities only sometimes. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that rural entrepreneurs have lower costs and thus tend to require smaller initial loans than urban entrepreneurs do has no bearing on rural borrowers strategically choosing to sell their goods less frequently than they could specifically to increase their profits per unit sold. The cost of producing goods doesn’t depend on the frequency with which an entrepreneur sells those goods, so lower frequency alone wouldn’t affect profits, and the initial loan amount is set and has nothing to do with how much profit is earned from each sale.",

The text further indicates that the researchers noted cracks in the fine grains that suggest there were cycles of desiccation, or drying, at the site. Taken together, this information suggests that a lake (a body of low-flow water) existed at the site for a prolonged period but occasionally experienced drying and that there were periods in which one or more streams (flowing water) were present, since the extended existence of a lake would account for the abundance of fine grains, periods of drying would account for the cracks in the fine grains, and periods with streams would account for the sections of coarse grains.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that an abundance of fine grains of sediment was found at the Murray Formation site, which suggests that a low-flow water source (such as a lake) was present.

The text then says that recent analysis suggests the wood in Cremonese violins was chemically treated by the craftspeople who made them, thereby providing an alternate explanation for the sound differences: the chemical alteration that is present in the Cremonese violins but absent from the modern ones.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text does not discuss how the sound quality of Cremonese violins compares with the sound quality of other instruments made during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. Instead it focuses on how the sound of the Cremonese violins compares with that of modern violins. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that there are differences in sound quality between the Cremonese and modern violins, and that both types of violin are made with maple or spruce. Thus the type of wood alone does not determine a violin’s sound quality. Furthermore, even if the type of wood alone could account for differences in sound quality, the text makes no mention of other woods, so there is no basis to judge how modern violins would sound if they were made using woods besides maple and spruce. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that there is evidence that Cremonese craftspeople chemically treated the wood used in Cremonese violins. This evidence is attributed to “new analysis,” which strongly suggests that this process was unknown to modern violin makers before that analysis. If the chemical treatment was unknown until recently, the manufacturing process for modern violins must differ with respect to the previously unknown practice of chemically treating the wood.",

Although Dingle’s baskets are described as being made using sweetgrass and palm, there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the baskets are “represented by,” or exemplified or portrayed by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm.

The text states that the invention radically altered the semiconductor industry, with some historians claiming that it had a fundamental effect on the industry by allowing for mass production for the first time. This context conveys that the invention of the integrated circuit transformed the semiconductor industry.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the invention of the integrated circuit significantly affected (\"radically altered\") the semiconductor industry, it doesn’t indicate that the invention \"overwhelmed\" the industry, which in this context would mean that it overcame the industry such that the industry struggled or was defeated. Instead, the text conveys that the invention’s effect was positive, since it allowed the semiconductor industry to begin making use of mass production methods. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that the invention of the integrated circuit \"bypassed\" the semiconductor industry, which would mean it intentionally avoided the industry. The text indicates that the invention directly affected the semiconductor industry, since it made it possible for the industry to begin engaging in mass production methods.

Choice C is incorrect. \"Ambiguous\" means \"unclear\" or \"open to multiple interpretations.\" However, it’s actually Johnson who encouraged multiple interpretations (\"diverse perspectives\"). Since Du Bois and Locke are said to \"diverge\" from Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but instead clear and firm (a \"unified vision\").

The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reflect the film’s unique stories rather than making them appear realistic. Therefore, the function of the underlined question is to reflect a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because, as the text makes clear, the underlined question is one posed by computer animators who wish to create realistic backgrounds and lighting effects, not by those who, instead, wish to create effects that reflect films’ unique stories and aren’t necessarily realistic; this latter group of animators is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it.

    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how Maggie Lena Walker addressed the lack of financial services available to Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, at the turn of the twentieth century. In this context, \"rectify\" means to correct or remedy something undesirable. The text indicates that by chartering the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank in 1903, Walker took action to provide local Black residents with greater access to financial services like home loans and savings opportunities. This context supports the idea that she aimed to rectify the undesirable situation affecting these residents.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"prolong\" would mean to lengthen something in time. The text indicates that at the turn of the twentieth century, Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, were faced with a lack of formal banking options. The text then states that Walker founded a new bank that provided these residents with financial services. Therefore, instead of prolonging the situation, she took steps to rectify, or correct, it. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"retain\" would mean to continue to have or to keep something. According to the text, at the turn of the twentieth century, Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, had few formal banking options, and Walker chartered a new institution to provide these residents with expanded financial services; therefore, she took steps to rectify, not retain, the situation. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"highlight\" would mean to emphasize or call attention to something, but the text indicates that Walker took concrete steps beyond merely drawing attention to the situation Black residents were facing in Richmond, Virginia, at the turn of the twentieth century. According to the text, Walker worked to rectify, or correct, the lack of formal banking options that were available to these residents by establishing a bank that provided them with home loans and savings opportunities.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text states that Shakti knows the woods she is walking in well. The next sentence, which is underlined, emphasizes Shakti’s familiarity with, and sense of security within, the woods by describing how the tree branches are friendly and “welcoming,” as they are depicted as extending open arms to her. The remainder of the text also shows that Shakti is comfortable and content in the woods by describing her as “an old friend” of the trees. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to emphasize Shakti’s sense of belonging in the wooded landscape that she visits.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text and underlined portion suggest that Shakti is comfortable, not uncomfortable, in her surroundings: the trees around her are described as welcoming and reassuring. Moreover, the underlined portion discusses Shakti’s feelings in the forest, not the river, since she hasn’t reached the river yet. Choice B is incorrect because the text and underlined portion emphasize Shakti’s familiarity with the woods. The trees are inviting, and she feels like “an old friend” to the woods, so she isn’t lost or confused there. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence uses the phrase “as an old friend” figuratively in reference to Shakti’s sense of familiarity with the landscape, not in reference to her long-standing friendships with other people, and the text and underlined portion never discuss her feelings about such friendships.",

    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the significance of the 2014 archaeological finding at El Algar. In this context, “concede” means to admit something is true after first resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe “Bronze Age societies were ruled by men.” But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included “valuable objects signaling a high position of power,” which would raise the possibility that “women may have also held leadership roles.” Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because “waive” means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be observed; the word isn’t used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid, as is the case in the text. Choice C is incorrect. According to the text, the finding from the El Algar burial site undermines the view that Bronze Age societies were exclusively ruled by men. However, “refute” means to demonstrate that something is false and would not make sense in context. Lull and team’s finding supports the view that women may have also held leadership roles, not that they did not participate in such roles. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “require” means to demand or specify as mandatory. However, it would not make sense for contemporary researchers to demand that Bronze Age “women may have also held leadership roles.”",

The underlined sentence in Text 1 describes a common scenario in which two friends are deciding on a lunch location. Text 1 goes on to explain that people often don’t reveal their true preferences in such situations, instead claiming they’re fine with any option so that they can appear more easygoing and likable. Text 2 presents research that advises against this approach, stating that people who don’t express their preferences aren’t viewed as more likable and that this behavior actually makes decisions more difficult for others. Since Text 2 specifically argues against the strategy of concealing preferences and indicates negative outcomes from doing so, the author of Text 2 would most likely recommend stating a preference about where to eat.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that canceling plans is a good solution. The author of Text 2 is addressing how to make joint decisions effectively (through stating your own preference), not advocating for avoiding such decisions entirely. Choice B is incorrect because asking where the friend typically likes to eat still avoids stating one’s own preference. While this approach might seem considerate, it continues the pattern of not revealing true preferences that Text 2 identifies as problematic. Choice D is incorrect because changing the subject would avoid making any decision altogether, which contradicts the implied advice in Text 2.

The text then goes on to describe the design of Hanel and colleagues’ experiment. By comparing interactions between members of an experimental group (who had been prompted to write about their personal values beforehand) to those between members of a control group (who had been prompted to write about a beverage), the team found that people in the experimental group behaved more civilly, or politely, than people in the control group did during discussions about a controversial topic.

    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Hishida Shunsō’s painting Cat and Plum Blossoms. In this context, \"embraced\" means accepted or adopted readily. The text begins by identifying Cat and Plum Blossoms as an example of Nihonga, or classical (that is, traditional) Japanese painting. The text continues by drawing a contrast between Hishida’s work and Kuroda Seiki’s work, which differs from that of Hishida in its use of the traditional European method of using oil paints on canvas rather than using traditional Japanese approaches. The text then concludes with an example of one such traditional Japanese painting technique exemplified by Hishida’s Cat and Plum Blossoms—applications of color pigments to a silk scroll—to further develop the contrast between the two artists’ approaches. This context supports the idea that Hishida adopted, or embraced, traditional Japanese approaches.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context \"distrusted\" would mean that Hishida was skeptical of or lacked confidence in traditional Japanese approaches to painting. The text begins by stating that Hishida’s painting Cat and Plum Blossoms is an example of Nihonga, or traditional Japanese painting, and then cites Hishida’s application of color pigments to a silk scroll as an instance of a traditional Japanese painting technique. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that Hishida’s use of traditional Japanese painting techniques indicates his distrust, or skepticism, of them. Rather, it suggests that he embraced those techniques. Choice C is incorrect because saying that Hishida \"released\" traditional Japanese approaches to painting in this context would mean that he freed them from any restrictions. In using Hishida’s application of color pigments to a silk scroll in Cat and Plum Blossoms as an example of a traditional Japanese approach to painting found in Nihonga, the text strongly implies that Hishida followed these approaches, not that he removed them from any restrictions. Choice D is incorrect because in this context \"overlooked\" would mean ignored or failed to notice. The text establishes that Hishida’s painting Cat and Plum Blossoms is a notable work of Nihonga, or classical Japanese painting, that features the traditional technique of applying color pigments to a silk scroll. It wouldn’t make sense to say that Hishida’s use of a traditional Japanese approach to painting indicates that Hishida failed to notice those approaches.",

Finally, the third sentence indicates that researcher Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues investigated a possible method of obtaining the necessary information about Betelgeuse’s internal characteristics, though they found that the method wouldn’t be sufficient. Thus, the function of the second sentence is to identify the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but didn’t.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not a serious limitation of how Nance and colleagues tried to solve it.

In this context, \"corroborate\" means confirm or support with evidence. The text indicates that one possible explanation for the relationship being discussed is that practitioners may overlook confounding variables—that is, additional factors other than the medical interventions being investigated that affect the observed outcomes. This means that practitioners may assume that an outcome is the direct result of a medical intervention when it is actually the result of a combination of factors. Clinical trials take steps to rule out factors other than the one being studied, so if those extra factors are actually having an effect on real-world outcomes, the trials are likely to produce conclusions different from those practitioners reach in their real-world observations.

In this context, \"optimize\" means make the most effective possible use of available opportunities. The text indicates that though businesses typically try to promote themselves, they don’t always make use of effective tools for doing so, pointing to research showing that 33 percent of restaurants failed to use a free listing service that increased revenue by 5 percent on average for restaurants that did use the service. The text therefore suggests that by foregoing a free and effective marketing tool, some businesses aren’t making the best use of, or optimizing, marketing opportunities.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"adorn\" would mean decorate or enhance the appearance of, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that by failing to use a free and effective promotional tool, some businesses aren’t enhancing the appearance of their own marketing. The example in the text illustrates that some businesses aren’t utilizing an effective marketing opportunity, not that they aren’t improving the appearance of their marketing. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"endorse\" would mean openly approve or recommend, and the text’s discussion of the fact that some businesses have overlooked an effective marketing tool doesn’t support the idea that those businesses therefore don’t approve of their own marketing.

    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about people’s tendency to dismiss claims from sources perceived as self-interested, or acting for their own advantage. In this context, \"irrelevant\" means not applicable to the matter at hand. The text explains that as a matter of logical reasoning, the source of a claim has nothing to do with the claim’s truthfulness—a claim is either true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates. This context suggests that even though people may distrust a claim based on its source, the source of the claim is actually irrelevant.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"indistinct\" would mean uncertain or not clearly recognizable. Instead of suggesting that the source of a claim can’t be determined with certainty, the text suggests that recognizing a source and having an opinion of it simply doesn’t matter because as a matter of logic, a claim is true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"indisputable\" would mean impossible to question or deny. Although the text suggests that it isn’t logical to assume a claim is false just because its source appears to be self-interested, it doesn’t go so far as to suggest that the source of a claim can’t be questioned—the text instead makes the point that from a logical standpoint, the source of a claim doesn’t matter because the claim is either true or false in and of itself. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"implicit\" would mean suggested or understood without being directly expressed. Nothing in the text suggests that logically, the source of a claim is only suggested; instead of addressing whether sources can be directly identified, the text focuses on the idea that sources don’t matter because a claim is true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates.",

    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Sterlin Harjo’s approach to representing Native characters on television. As used in this context, “repudiates” means rejects or refuses to have anything to do with. The text indicates that television shows tend to depict Native characters as living long ago, but that Harjo’s series Reservation Dogs focuses on Native teenagers in the present day, representing a “rejection” of the typical approach to depicting Native characters. This context thus indicates that Harjo repudiates television’s general tendency regarding Native characters. \n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text describes Harjo’s “rejection” of the typical approach to representing Native characters on television, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that Harjo “proclaims,” or declares or affirms, television’s general tendency regarding Native characters. Harjo is described as refusing to follow the pattern of depicting Native characters in the distant past, not as proclaiming that pattern. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes television’s tendency to represent Native characters in the distant past as something that is already occurring, not as something that Harjo “foretells,” or predicts will happen in the future. The text is focused on Harjo’s “rejection” of this pattern, not on any predictions he may have about it. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Harjo “recants” something would mean that he withdraws a previously held belief, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that Harjo recants television’s tendency to represent Native characters as living in the past. No beliefs previously held by Harjo are mentioned. Additionally, a tendency isn’t a belief and thus isn’t something that can be recanted.",

The text states that the zoo is “huge,” that it covers “numberless acres,” and that it is large enough that a train is needed to explore it. Thus, the text’s emphasis on the zoo’s size suggests that the zoo extended, or stretched, over a large area of land.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because if the zoo covers “numberless acres,” then it could not reasonably be described as hidden, or concealed from view. Choice B is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the zoo was discussed, or talked about. Rather, the text focuses on the zoo’s large size. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts “spread” can mean coated, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because to coat something means to apply a thin layer of a liquid substance, such as oil or paint, to a surface.

The text states that insect damage may cause viburnum plants to be discolored and have abnormal growths.

Thus, the context contrasts the appearance of healthy, undamaged plants with the appearance of damaged plants.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, “struggling” would mean working against difficulties. The text first describes viburnum plants experiencing damage by insects, and the phrase “on the other hand” then establishes a contrast with that description. It wouldn’t make sense to contrast struggling viburnum plants with those being damaged by insects, because in both cases the plants would be experiencing difficulties. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “beneficial” would mean producing good or helpful effects. The text doesn’t discuss how viburnum plants affect other things or suggest that the plants are helpful in some way; rather, it focuses on how viburnum plants are affected by certain conditions.

The last sentence of the text then provides an example of an observation that suggests the workers’ process changed: clear misalignment of the borders of the two panels the workers joined first and virtually invisible joins completed later. Thus, the underlined sentence serves to support an argument about the workers who produced the tapestry.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the example given in the last sentence of the text has to do with how the panels of the Bayeux Tapestry were joined by the workers, not with what is depicted in those panels; the text never identifies any people or places depicted in the tapestry. Choice C is incorrect because the last sentence compares how early panels in the Bayeux Tapestry were joined with how later panels in the same tapestry were joined; it doesn’t make any comparison between the Bayeux Tapestry and other tapestries from the same time in France.

Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"a superficial\" account would be one that is lacking in depth or concerned only with what is obvious. The text indicates that most evidence of Hatshepsut’s reign was purposely destroyed, which suggests that accounts of that time are likely already somewhat superficial, since there is little information available to support deeper knowledge. Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be superficial. Choice D is incorrect because \"a questionable\" account would be one likely to be challenged or doubted, and since the text suggests that little evidence of Hatshepsut’s reign has survived, accounts of that time probably involve some speculation and thus may already be open to doubt.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text, which is to convey the speaker’s longing for the ocean to impart a sense of inner tranquility, or peace. The text begins by expressing the speaker’s strong desire to be on the ocean, appealing directly to the waves to rock the speaker to sleep. The poem then describes the \"slumberous lullaby\" formed by the sound of the waves and the winds on which the speaker wishes to be carried \"gently...between a peaceful sea and sky.\" All these details serve to emphasize the speaker’s desire for the ocean to give them a sense of inner tranquility.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Given the poem’s expression of a longing to achieve tranquility by drifting on the ocean, it can be inferred that the speaker desires to escape something unpleasant in daily life. However, the poem doesn’t refer directly to any such hardship—ongoing or otherwise. And since the poem doesn’t establish that the speaker is experiencing a desire to escape ongoing hardship, it can’t be said that such a desire increases in intensity. Choice B is incorrect. The speaker does express a desire for the serenity of being rocked to sleep by the ocean, and it can be inferred that this desire is a response to demands that make the speaker’s daily life stressful. However, the poem doesn’t refer directly to such demands or contrast them with the tranquility of drifting on the ocean. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest the speaker has any qualms, or reservations, about being transported by the ocean. On the contrary, the speaker actively desires to \"drift far out\" and be carried by the waves and wind. Moreover, the poem doesn’t suggest that this drifting would have any particular destination.",

At the start of the text, Jane says, “I went on with my day’s business tranquilly,” indicating that she is outwardly calm. This outward calmness is then contrasted with her intense internal restlessness, as Jane says that thoughts of leaving her job keep running through her mind, that she is “involuntarily framing advertisements” (meaning that she can’t stop herself from thinking up potential listings for jobs), and that she often wonders what new “situations” (or jobs) would be like. \n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of Jane’s feelings, either positive or negative, about the people she works for at Thornfield Hall.

Choice D is incorrect because the text describes Jane as wondering about getting a new job, not as determined to definitely do so. Jane keeps thinking about reasons why she “should” quit her current job (indicating that she hasn’t yet decided to) and imagining possible new situations she could find, but she says at the end of the text that these thoughts “might germinate and bear fruit if they could,” meaning that the thoughts haven’t yet led to a decision—that Jane isn’t yet determined to get a new job somewhere else.",

As a result, Jenkins began producing groundbreaking works of video art. This context supports the idea that Jenkins took advantage of newfound access to video cameras.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because “delicate” means fine in texture or structure or easily broken, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text doesn’t focus on describing what video art looks like or whether it’s breakable. Choice C is incorrect because “inevitable” means impossible to avoid, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text doesn’t discuss the likelihood of artists, or anyone else, gaining access to video cameras. Choice D is incorrect because “habitual” means doing something regularly or repeatedly. Although the text does suggest that Jenkins created multiple pieces of video art, its focus is on the fact that video cameras had only just become widely available to artists in the 1970s.

Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion does describe a consideration that led the researchers to recommend risk-disclosure messaging despite the messaging’s small effects on consumer behavior, it directly states that the cost of such messaging is negligible, or very low—meaning that both the effects and the costs are small, not that the effects are small only relative to the costs. Choice D is incorrect because there’s no indication that Seira et al. suggest that risk-disclosure messaging could be more effective if it had lower costs; rather, the underlined portion indicates that Seira et al. believe the already negligible cost of messaging makes the approach worth pursuing even if its effects are limited.",

Umami—one of the five basic tastes along with sweet, bitter, salty, and sour—was formally classified when its taste receptors were discovered in the 2000s. In 2007, to define the pure umami flavor scientists Rie Ishii and Michael O’Mahony used broths made from shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed, and two panels of Japanese and US judges closely agreed on a description of the taste.\n\nText 2\n\nA 2022 experiment by Manon Jünger et al. led to a greater understanding of soy sauce’s flavor profile. The team initially presented a mixture of compounds with low molecular weights to taste testers who found it was not as salty or bitter as real soy sauce. Further analysis of soy sauce identified proteins, including dipeptides, that enhanced umami flavor and also contributed to saltiness. The team then made a mix of 50 chemical compounds that re-created soy sauce’s flavor.",

Ishii and O’Mahony were trying to isolate the pure umami flavor, while Jünger was trying to recreate soy sauce, which has a mix of flavors that includes umami. Accordingly, the broths from Text 1 are not described as having any soy sauce in them—just “shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed.” So they probably don’t have as much of the dipeptides described in Text 2, which were found to be a key part of soy sauce’s umami-ness and its saltiness.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Neither text supports this. Neither text gets into the diets of people in the United States, nor the diets of people in Japan. Choice B is incorrect. Neither text supports this.

As used in this context, “complexity” means having many complicated parts that when taken as a whole are difficult to follow or explain. The text indicates that The Books of Jacob has a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot (that is, a plot that is difficult to follow), and reverse page numbering. Together, these features make up a novel that’s challenging to read and summarize. This context supports the idea that a brief book review can’t do justice to the novel’s complexity.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the word “accuracy,” or being free from error or falsehood, can sometimes be used to describe a novel, the text doesn’t discuss whether Tokarczuk’s novel has this quality. Instead, the text describes the novel as having a large cast of characters, a difficult-to-follow plot, and reverse page numbering. These features suggest complexity, not accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because “inactivity” means being in a state of idleness or doing nothing, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text describes Tokarczuk’s novel, and although it’s possible the novel could portray its characters as inactive, it wouldn’t make sense to describe the novel itself as such. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “restraint” would mean holding back or showing self-control, and the text doesn’t indicate that Tokarczuk’s novel has either of these qualities. In fact, the features of the novel that the text describes, such as a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot, and reverse page numbering, suggest excess and complexity, not restraint.",

    "correct_answer": "D",
    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer’s team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer’s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn’t appear to contain any life. Fierer’s team says that though this doesn’t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it’s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer’s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer’s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer’s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer’s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn’t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer’s team wouldn’t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn’t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer’s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn’t detect them, but the author doesn’t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer’s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples.",

In this context, “widespread” means widely accepted or practiced. The text indicates that because Sequoyah’s script accurately represented the spoken sounds of the Cherokee language and was easy to learn, nearly all Cherokee people were able to read and write it soon after it was created. This context demonstrates that the script was widely used by the Cherokee people.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. In this context, “careful” would mean exercised with care and attentive concern. Although the work of creating a writing system likely involved great care, the text indicates that the system was “easy to learn,” which conflicts with the idea that using this system requires a noteworthy amount of care. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “unintended” means not deliberate. The idea that using Sequoyah’s script was unintentional conflicts directly with the claim that it was easy to learn and used by “over 90% of the Cherokee people” by 1830. In fact, because one had to learn this system, it’s not clear how one could use it unintentionally. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “infrequent” means rare or not occurring often, which conflicts directly with the claim that “over 90% of the Cherokee people” were using Sequoyah’s script by 1830.",

The text begins by stating that companies are increasingly giving consumers opportunities to customize products, allowing them to make design choices when buying certain sneakers, jewelry, and clothing. The text then indicates that although this trend benefits companies because they can successfully charge buyers more for customized products and don’t have to rush production, it also poses a challenge because producing unique items may require different and more expensive methods than the ones typically used for mass production, raising the companies’ costs. Thus, the text first introduces a trend in consumer products and then explains how the trend both benefits and poses a challenge to companies.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t present the customization of various products as a recent innovation—the fact that there are \"more opportunities\" now indicates that there were opportunities before—and no other innovations, in product manufacturing or otherwise, are discussed.

At the time, painting was not yet respected as a profession, so painters mostly chose to emphasize other qualities in their self-portraits, like their intellect or social status. In the city of Bologna, the first artist to depict themself painting was a man named Annibale Carracci. A painting of his from around 1585 shows Carracci in front of an easel holding a palette.\n\nText 2\n\nIn their self-portraits, Bolognese artists typically avoided referring to the act of painting until the mid-1600s. However, Lavinia Fontana’s 1577 painting, Self-Portrait at the Keyboard, stands out as the earliest example of such a work by an artist from Bologna.

Choice D is incorrect because neither text discusses how likely lithium and sodium are to be detected by analyzing wavelengths of light.",

    "rationale": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text notes that although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as a \"case in point\" (that is, as an example of the point made previously). According to the text, O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same—posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion of O’Brien and Ahmed’s study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture’s effects on cognition.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text discusses O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as an example of why caution is needed when discussing posture’s effects on cognition, not as an example of how research findings related to posture and cognition are often misunderstood. Although the text does warn against misunderstanding the scope of the relationship between posture and cognition that has been reported in some previous studies, O’Brien and Ahmed’s study is not one of those studies, and there is no suggestion that anyone has misunderstood O’Brien and Ahmed’s findings. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the methods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution when discussing posture’s effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that posture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken too broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture’s effects on cognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O’Brien and Ahmed share that view or that they attempted to solve that problem.

But laws of physics at a microscopic or quantum level hold that those processes should be reversible.\n\nText 2\n\nIn 2015, physicists Tiago Batalhão et al. performed an experiment in which they confirmed the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes at a quantum level, producing entropy by applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field to a system of carbon-13 atoms in liquid chloroform.

However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn’t be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are \"beautifully written\" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel.

Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn’t be classified as literature based on their limited use of language, there’s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a flaw, just that it doesn’t fit the particular definition of \"literature\" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are \"beautifully written,\" and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed.

The narrator is in a taxi as it drives down a street lined with so many food vendors and shoppers that the narrator describes them as \"the multitude of Paris,\" meaning an immense group of people. The street is essentially a large open-air market, and there are so many people pushing small wagons of goods and carrying shopping baskets that \"every inch\" of the taxi’s progress is impeded. In other words, the people are providing resistance to the taxi’s attempt to drive down the street.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean arguing, the narrator doesn’t portray the shoppers and vendors as arguing with the driver of the taxi or, indeed, arguing at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean expressing disapproval, the narrator doesn’t suggest that the shoppers and vendors necessarily disapprove of the taxi’s attempt to drive down the street. Instead, their combined presence along the street has the effect of impeding the taxi’s progress. Choice C is incorrect because, as the narrator explains, both the multitude of people and the taxi are using a public space (a street) at the same time. The narrator doesn’t go so far as to suggest that the people feel that they, and not the taxi, possess exclusive access to the street.",

The author of Text 1 points out that mycoprotein is not widely available because of its high production cost, but goes on to note that this problem could be addressed by the creation of a cheaper substrate to feed mycoprotein. This suggests that the author of Text 1 would assert that the development of a less expensive mycoprotein substrate would contribute to the reduction in deforestation described in the study findings discussed in Text 2: if reducing the cost of mycoprotein increases people’s access to it, then mycoprotein may be able to replace beef in more people’s diets, thereby reducing the deforestation associated with beef production.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the environmental impact of mycoprotein production is close to that of chicken or pork production, so there is no reason to think that the author would assert that replacing chicken or pork with mycoprotein would be environmentally beneficial: such a replacement would not lessen the total environmental impact of food manufacture. Additionally, the specific issue of agricultural water consumption is never mentioned in Text 1, so there is no evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would say about that issue.

The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a flamingo that is pinker than another flamingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a flamingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the flamingo’s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker flamingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn’t the only thing that influences flamingos’ coloring.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that flamingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers.

Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about flamingos’ shrimp consumption.

    ],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by explaining that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, but how deeply these effects are seen in the soil remains an unresolved question. Next, the text summarizes Okolo and colleagues’ hypothesis regarding this question—which is that the different effects on carbon and nitrogen levels associated with different types of land use would also be observed below the topsoil layer—and then briefly explains the methods they used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the text states that the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all land-use types, a finding that conflicts with the team’s hypothesis presented earlier in the text. Thus, the text introduces an unresolved scientific question, presents a research team’s hypothesis pertaining to that question, and then describes an observation that the team made that conflicted with their hypothesis.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text introduces a phenomenon (the fact that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil) that isn’t fully understood by scientists and explains a research team’s hypothesis about the phenomenon, the text doesn’t describe how the team refined their hypothesis when a research finding contradicted it. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss a process at all; rather, it poses an unsolved scientific question and presents a hypothesis that Okolo and colleagues tested to answer that question. Moreover, the text only describes one hypothesis; it doesn’t mention any competing hypotheses, nor does it suggest that Okolo’s team was able to determine which hypothesis was correct. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t begin by presenting a hypothesis that is under scientific debate; rather, it presents a question that scientists have been unable to answer and then introduces a hypothesis formulated by Okolo and colleagues. While the text does explain how Okolo’s team tested their hypothesis, the text goes on to say that their data conflicted with their hypothesis, not that the data validated, or supported, their hypothesis.",

    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of architectural influences among Mesoamerican cities. In this context, “commonalities with” means similarities to or shared attributes with. The text indicates that a recently discovered citadel in Tikal includes a close imitation of a famous temple in Teotihuacán (another Mesoamerican city) and other evidence of Teotihuacán influence, which suggests that the citadel possesses features that resemble architectural features found in Teotihuacán. This context thus indicates that the Tikal citadel shows commonalities with Teotihuacán architecture.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the Tikal citadel shows “refinements of,” or improvements on, Teotihuacán architecture. Although the text suggests that the architecture of Teotihuacán influenced the architecture of the Tikal citadel, and although it’s possible that later architectural designs could make improvements on earlier designs, the text doesn’t discuss whether, in imitating Teotihuacán architecture, the Tikal citadel’s builders improved on it. Choice B is incorrect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showing “precursors of” Teotihuacán architecture—or features that preceded and foreshadowed those of Teotihuacán architecture—would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about the relationship between the architecture found in Tikal and Teotihuacán. The text claims that the discovery of similarities between the Tikal citadel and the architecture of Teotihuacán, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuacán, provides evidence of outside influences on Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was influenced by Teotihuacán architecture, then the Teotihuacán architecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around. In this context, therefore, it wouldn’t make sense to say that the Tikal citadel shows precursors of Teotihuacán architecture. Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses how the citadel in Tikal indicates the influence of Teotihuacán architecture, which implies that the makers of the Tikal citadel likely admired aspects of Teotihuacán architecture enough to imitate it. Thus, there’s no reason to think that the Tikal citadel provides evidence of the Tikal people’s “animosities toward,” or feelings of strong dislike or hostility toward, Teotihuacán architecture.",

The speaker ultimately confesses to falling in love with the woman in the painting, who has \"stole[n] away\" the speaker’s heart, but first the speaker describes elements of the painting’s setting. These include sterile soil, barren fields with \"no ray / Of hope in a blade of green\"—a description that conveys a mood of melancholy and forlornness, possibly reflecting the speaker’s own sadness at falling in love with an image that can’t return the speaker’s love. The text continues by stating that there’s no \"sheltering roof\" in the painting, even though the \"skies are heavy and gray,\" showing signs of an impending storm. Generally, a roof’s intended purpose is to provide protection from the elements, and in this context, a roof would offer shelter and protection from the gathering storm.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that a roof would be restrictive—that is, that it would limit or restrain something in some way. Although a roof would provide some cover from stormy winds and rain, it wouldn’t limit the wind and rain, only deflect them. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that if a \"sheltering roof\" were present in the painting, it would be affectionate, or loving and tender. In the text, the immediate context in which the word \"sheltering\" appears refers to the absence of a roof that would provide protection from the oncoming storm depicted in the painting, not to the idea that such a shelter would be loving and tender if it were present.

He is merely distracted by them. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that Mr. Spring Fragrance’s ears couldn’t help entering, or coming into, the words coming to him through the window.

Text 1 describes Sharif’s study of the benefits of free time, saying that the reported sense of satisfaction plateaued at two hours per day and began to decline at five hours per day. Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she defines as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction.  However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective definition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others. It can be inferred that Maddux would also assert that whether watching TV or playing games is productive or unproductive is a matter of subjective judgment. Thus, Maddux would most likely caution against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction: some may want to spend that time productively, others unproductively, and what counts as productive is subjective. Therefore, Maddux would likely not consider it universally true that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively. Choice B is incorrect because the study described in Text 1 concerns whether free time contributes to life satisfaction, not whether productivity contributes to life satisfaction. The dip in life satisfaction that Sharif claims to observe in Text 1 happens only after five hours, and mainly if the time is spent unproductively—that is, two hours of free time spent productively might increase life satisfaction just as much as two hours spent unproductively. Choice D is incorrect because Maddux holds the opinion that whether an activity is productive or unproductive is subjective and depends on the individual; therefore, he would most likely claim that watching TV or playing games might be productive for some and unproductive for others.",

His most important paper, “A Mathematical Theory of Communication,” published in 1948 when he was employed at Bell Labs, utilized a concept called a “binary digit” (shortened to “bit”) to measure the amount of information in any signal and determine the fastest rate at which information could be transmitted while still being reliably decipherable. Robert Gallagher, one of Shannon’s colleagues, said that the bit was “[Shannon’s] discovery, and from it the whole communications revolution has sprung.”",

Thus, cassava remained relatively unknown to most of the region’s inhabitants until the 1800s.\n\nText 2\n\nCassava’s slow adoption into the diet of West Africans is mainly due to the nature of the crop itself. If not cooked properly, cassava can be toxic. Knowledge of how to properly prepare cassava needed to spread before the food could grow in popularity.

The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers (for example, symmetrical composition tends to emphasize similarity among elements, whereas asymmetry tends to emphasize difference). Thus, there is a strong connection between what a photograph conveys and how its elements are balanced. Therefore, what a photo conveys is contingent on how it is balanced.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In this context, \"inhibited by\" most nearly means hindered or undermined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers, thereby indicating a relationship between image balance and what is conveyed. Although this explanation is consistent with a photographer choosing asymmetrical balance even while intending to convey similarity (associated with symmetrical balance), there is nothing to indicate that messages generally are inhibited by balance. Rather the implication is that balance is a tool photographers can use to craft their messages. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"obligated to\" means duty bound toward or answerable to. In context, it would not make sense to assert that a photograph’s message is obligated to how that photograph is balanced. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"reserved for\" most nearly means solely available to someone or held aside for some purpose.

The text implies, however, that recent scholarship has shown that his works still had an impact on other Muslim philosophers of his time.

As used in this context, “buttress” means to strengthen or defend. The text indicates that regardless of whether a French monarch’s reign was significant or uneventful, each monarch faced questions about his right to the throne. The text goes on to say that in order to understand the path of a French monarch’s reign, it’s important to understand what contributed to the monarch’s ability to “hold the throne.” This context suggests that French monarchs such as Hugh Capet and Henry I had to buttress, or defend, their right to be monarch. \n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to “disengage,” or withdraw his right to the French throne. The text focuses on an examination of people who reigned as French monarchs, not on people who didn’t choose to rule. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to “annotate,” or add notes to or explain, his right to the French throne. Nothing in the text suggests that the monarchs were writing notes about their right to the throne; instead, faced with questions about the legitimacy of their reign, the monarchs defended their right. Choice D is incorrect. Saying that a monarch who is faced with questions about the legitimacy of his reign was able to “reciprocate” his right to the French throne would mean that he either returned his right to the throne or that he responded in kind to the challenge.

The text concludes by explaining that these plants are all descendants of \"a single ancestral tarweed plant\" that arrived 5 million years ago in the Hawaiian Islands, where a \"wide variety of habitats\" drove the plant’s descendants to adapt and thus differentiate themselves, diversifying into a group of related but distinct species with different physical characteristics.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text explains why the plants within the silversword alliance have varied physical characteristics, the text doesn’t suggest that tarweed is the ancestor of all plants on the Hawaiian Islands. The text states instead that all members of the silversword alliance descend from a single tarweed ancestor. Choice B is incorrect because while Dubautia carrii is mentioned as an example of a species in the silversword alliance, no details about its particular habitat are provided.

Text 1 notes that in film and television, on the other hand, credits are used consistently and are valuable to researchers studying the cast and crew members in these mediums. Since Text 1 asserts how the consistent use of credits benefits scholars of film and television, it can be inferred that this text’s author would respond to the discussion in Text 2 by observing that the kind of problem faced by scholars of video games—the inability to know who contributed to a particular production and how—is, in film and television studies, largely prevented by the widespread practice of credits in these mediums.\n\nChoice A is incorrect.

Moreover, Text 1 states that films and television shows themselves, not their researchers, regularly use the method of listing credits. Choice B is incorrect.

This phenomenon is linked to the growing “experiential economy,” where many find it gratifying to purchase lived experiences. To ensure a profitable event, venues need to consider the overall consumer experience, not just the band lineup.\n\nText 2\n\nMusic festival appearances are becoming a more important part of musicians’ careers. One factor in this shift is the rising use of streaming services that allow access to huge numbers of songs for a monthly fee, subsequently reducing sales of full-length albums. With this shift in consumer behavior, musicians are increasingly dependent on revenue from live performances.",

Text 1 states that consumers enjoy purchasing “lived experiences,” and that this influences how organizers design music festivals. Text 2 states that consumers are using streaming services more, and that this reduces album sales and increases the importance of live performances for musicians.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Neither text claims that consumers prefer streaming to festivals, or that these are mutually exclusive options. Text 1 implies that festivals are popular and profitable, and Text 2 never suggests that streaming services diminish the demand for live music. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads Text 1, which identifies music festivals as just one example of a broader trend of purchasing “lived experiences.” Text 2 doesn’t mention growing interest in purchasing experiences, in the music industry or otherwise. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text establishes a cause/effect relationship between the demand for festivals and the demand for streaming platforms. Text 1 does not mention streaming platforms at all, and Text 2 does not imply that streaming platforms benefit from the popularity of festivals.",

The text establishes that unlike what critics believe, Okuma creates works that are in art museums and available for the public to purchase, suggesting that critics believe fine art and fashion rarely overlap, not that they rarely succumb. Choice C is incorrect because saying that critics believe that fine art and fashion rarely “diverge,” or disagree or move in different directions, wouldn’t make sense in context.

    "rationale": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by describing a study’s finding about greater short-nosed fruit bats—namely, that high moonlight intensity inhibits the bats’ activity—and also accounts for that finding, stating that this occurs because the potential increase in foraging success that greater lunar intensity enables doesn’t offset these bats’ increased vulnerability to predators (whose vision is also implied to become more acute under intense moonlight). The text goes on to characterize this finding as representative of a general pattern, stating that many nocturnal mammals behave similarly in response to changes in lunar intensity. The text concludes by describing an exception to this pattern, explaining that mongoose lemurs display an opposite tendency because they rely heavily on visual foraging. This strategy presumably would allow them to derive more benefit from greater lunar intensity than many other nocturnal mammals would, resulting in a \"different balance of reward and risk\" than exists for other nocturnal mammals. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as a description and account of a finding, a characterization of that finding as representative of a pattern, and then a description and account of an exception to that pattern.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses two different responses to variations in moonlight intensity, explaining that as moonlight intensity increases, greater short-nosed fruit bats and many other nocturnal mammals decrease their foraging activity but mongoose lemurs increase their foraging activity, it doesn’t leave one of these responses unexplained. The text accounts for both the typical response to increased lunar intensity (reduced activity due to predation risk) and the exception (increased activity due to a reliance on visual foraging) by making reference to a cost-benefit framework. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text presents a study′s finding about the effect of increased lunar intensity on greater short-nosed fruit bats’ activity before going on to contrast this behavior with the fact that mongoose lemurs display the opposite response to increased lunar intensity, the text doesn’t explicitly invoke other studies and doesn’t attribute this difference in observed behavior to the fact that the study of greater short-nosed fruit bats used different methods than studies of mongoose lemurs did. Rather, the text explains that the different observed behaviors can be attributed to differences in species’ foraging strategies. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text characterizes the behavior of mongoose lemurs in response to increased lunar intensity as an exception to a pattern of behavior observed in other nocturnal mammal species, this exception doesn’t cast any doubt on the explanation that is offered for the general pattern observed among other species. Instead, the text uses the same cost-benefit framework to explain why increased lunar intensity is associated with decreased activity by greater short-nosed fruit bats and other nocturnal mammals but with increased activity by mongoose lemurs.",

The narrator describes how Joe responds to being in “the metropolis”: he’s excited and “wild with enthusiasm.” He also envies the young fellows who walk by because, dressed as they are, they look as if they have somewhere special to go. The text contrasts this new place with the place Joe comes from, where apparently there wasn’t as much to do. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to illustrate Joe’s reaction to a new environment.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text makes no reference to why Joe has moved. The narrator indicates that Joe is enthusiastic about being in a city, but there’s no explanation provided for the move. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no reference to how Joe thinks about an event. The narrator describes young men passing by in the evening and then recalls places worth going to at home—church and a few people’s houses—but there’s no explicit comparison made nor is a time of day mentioned for these events back home. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t support the idea that Joe feels regret over leaving home. Instead, Joe is described as “wild with enthusiasm” at being in the city. Joe’s home is mentioned, but only to compare it unfavorably with the city.",

The text presents a finding and describes it as suggesting that healthy ocean sounds may encourage oyster larvae to establish a reef (a permanent home): groups of oyster larvae that heard recorded sounds of a healthy oyster reef were two times more likely to show signs of forming their own reef than groups that heard different ocean recordings were. This context conveys that the groups that heard healthy reef sounds had a more positive reaction than the other groups did—that is, they were the most responsive.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to become \"inactive,\" or to stop engaging in work or activity. Instead, the text conveys that the groups that heard those sounds were observed engaging in activity: they were two times more likely to create a reef (a permanent home) than groups that heard different ocean sounds were. Choice C is incorrect because describing the groups of oyster larvae that heard sounds of a healthy oyster reef as most \"liked,\" or regarded with pleasure, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that a study found that healthy reef sounds may encourage groups of oyster larvae to form reefs (permanent homes), not on the idea that some of the groups in the study were liked more than others. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to be \"distressed,\" or to experience difficulty or begin to decline. Instead, the text indicates that the sounds increased the likelihood that groups of larvae would establish a reef (a permanent home), suggesting that the sounds had a positive effect on the larvae.",

The text explains that Blind Spot consists of original photographs as well as poetic prose—two elements that correspond to Cole’s passions, identified in the text, for photography and the written word. This context suggests that Cole’s excitement about photography and writing led him to create a book that successfully combines the two mediums.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because describing Cole as feeling “indifference to” his two passions wouldn’t make sense in context. If Cole is indifferent to his passions, that would mean he doesn’t care about photography or writing—in which case they wouldn’t be his passions at all. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels “concern about,” or uneasiness about, his passions. The text’s use of the word “culminates” indicates that Blind Spot represents a triumphant climax of Cole’s passions, not a work that results from his sense of discomfort with photography and writing. Choice D is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels “surprise at,” or astonished by, his passions.

The text describes two types of libraries in first-century BCE Rome—private libraries controlled by wealthy individuals, and the public libraries like that commissioned by Emperor Augustus—and then notes that \"these two traditions aren’t as distinct as they seem.\" It explains that both private-library owners and the emperor saw their libraries as \"extensions of their personal patronage, just on vastly differing scales,\" because the emperor’s patronage extended to the whole citizenry of Rome. Thus, both private and public libraries in ancient Rome were fundamentally tied to relevant principles of patronage.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text mentions that Rome’s republican period only to say that it \"ended in the first century BCE,\" thus it doesn’t support any conclusions about possible occurrences \"throughout Rome’s republican period.\" Choice B is incorrect. The text neither discusses \"early imperial leaders in Rome,\" nor whether their level of influence was appropriate. Rather it discusses the end of \"Rome’s republican period\" in relation to libraries, who created them, and who got to use them without passing judgment on propriety. Choice D is incorrect.

Although the text mentions a shepherd, it neither indicates that the shepherd is singing nor does it compare the shepherd to the speaker. Choice C is incorrect. The text indicates that the speaker works hard, engaging in \"hours of toil,\" and it can be inferred that the speaker likely lives in a rural area, since cows and a cowbell can be heard nearby. However, the text does not suggest that the speaker is a farmer or feels excited about farming. Moreover, the shepherd in the text is not a literal reference to someone who herds sheep but instead a figurative description of the moon as the shepherd of the stars.

Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn’t specifically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specific collection of murals—or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as “a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit,” the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specific area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District.",

The text indicates that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats is “mutually beneficial” and involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. In other words, each organism provides the same kind of benefit it receives: the tree provides a nutrient (carbon) for the fungus and the fungus reciprocates by helping the tree to absorb more of another nutrient (nitrogen).\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Nothing in the text suggests that the fungus “overreacts,” or responds too strongly, by allowing the tree to be better able to absorb a beneficial nutrient.

The text illustrates this assertion by describing Whatley’s “determined advocacy” for the practice. This context suggests that critics’ concerns didn’t obstruct Whatley’s efforts, not that critics’ concerns didn’t “enhance,” or increase or improve, Whatley’s efforts. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, “misrepresent” would mean portray inaccurately, and the text includes no information relevant to the issue of how Whatley’s efforts were portrayed by critics of the practice of charging customers to pick their own produce.

These dissenters note that other mass extinctions have coincided with large volcanic eruptions, while only the K-Pg event lines up with an asteroid strike.\n\nText 2\n\nIn a 2020 study, Pincelli Hull and her colleagues analyzed ocean core samples and modeled climate changes around the K-Pg event.

According to Text 2, although Hull’s team found that activity in the Deccan Traps did indeed alter the climate before the K-Pg event, the team determined that the climate had returned to normal before mass extinctions began. This finding and the observation that the K-Pg extinctions closely align with the Chicxulub asteroid impact suggest that Hull’s team would likely dispute the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 and say that the climate changes caused by the Deccan Traps activity were not the main cause of the extinctions.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull’s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull’s team would disagree that the Deccan Traps activity caused the K-Pg event. Additionally, the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 says nothing about how the Chicxulub impact changed the climate, so while Hull’s team might believe that the impact did in fact change the climate, they could not be said to agree with the claim in Text 1 on this point. Choice C is incorrect because there is no indication in either text that any scientists assume that the Chicxulub impact caused the Deccan Traps activity, so there is no reason to conclude that Hull’s team would question why the scientists referred to in Text 1 make such an assumption. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull’s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull’s team would say that the Deccan Traps activity had a less enduring effect on global conditions than the scientists referenced in Text 1 believe, not that the effect on global conditions was more significant than those scientists claim.",

The text never suggests that Tinker-Smith’s choice was determined.

This moment marks a major cultural shift: a new way of representing and seeing the world had arrived with that train, and nothing would ever be the same.\n\nText 2\n\nThe fact that there is no contemporary evidence that the first audience of Arrival of the Train was alarmed has not stopped the story from becoming canonical, even among film historians. But that phenomenon itself is highly revealing.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it provides a statement about the description of the first showing of Arrival of the Train in Text 1 that, based on the texts, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with. Text 1 indicates that members of the audience, unaccustomed to the new medium of film and believing that they were looking at a real oncoming train, allegedly reacted to the film with alarm. Text 1 then goes on to treat this anecdote as a factual account of the film’s first showing, interpreting it as a moment that marked a \"major cultural shift.\" In contrast, the author of Text 2 indicates that though the story of the film’s first showing has become \"canonical,\" or widely accepted, there is no contemporary evidence to support the idea that the audience reacted as Text 1 describes. Text 2 goes on to explain that this factually questionable description likely persists because it functions as a \"founding myth\" that reinforces a widespread belief in the profoundly transformative nature of the invention of film. This indicates that the author of Text 2 would likely see the description in Text 1 as motivated primarily by cultural perceptions about film’s significance rather than by documented historical facts.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 doesn’t suggest that film historians regard the view about film’s transformative nature as naïve. On the contrary, Text 2 states that the story of the first showing of Arrival of the Train has become \"canonical, even among film historians,\" indicating that historians broadly accept this narrative as a compelling illustration of film’s impact, not that they regard either the narrative or the views it conveys about the transformative nature of film as naïve. Text 2 refers to a \"(naïve) ‘before’\" in cultural history, but this is describing how the myth itself characterizes pre-film audiences, not how historians regard views about the transformative nature of film. Choice C is incorrect. While the author of Text 2 does indicate that the story of the audience’s reaction to Arrival of the Train described in Text 1 is a myth that lacks evidence, the text doesn’t suggest that the story reflects the fact that film historians believe themselves to be more sophisticated than modern audiences are. Rather, Text 2 suggests that the story persists because of a collective cultural belief, which historians share, in the profound impact of the invention of film. Moreover, the \"naïve\" versus \"sophisticated\" distinction mentioned in Text 2 refers to how the myth characterizes audiences before and after the invention of film; it doesn’t characterize modern audiences versus film historians. Choice D is incorrect. Although the author of Text 2 would agree that the description of the first showing of Arrival of the Train in Text 1 reflects a misconception, the author wouldn’t agree that widespread belief in the misconception can be attributed to the fact that it accurately captures early audiences’ actual sense of alarm. In fact, the misconception identified by the author of Text 2 concerns the accuracy of the audience’s alleged reaction; the author questions whether early audiences were alarmed at all, stating there is \"no contemporary evidence\" that they reacted in this way. According to Text 2, the description is widely believed not because it accurately captures historical reactions but because it serves as a \"founding myth\" that supports a belief in film’s transformative cultural impact.",

Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that Woolf or Bell made a “discovery,” or encountered anything new for the first time as they worked together.

Cecily remarks on the deep pain of saying goodbye to people whom one has only known briefly and then comments on the equanimity, or calm steadiness, one experiences when separated from old friends. The text sets up an ironic contrast: one can easily tolerate, or put up with, the absence of close friends, but even a very short separation from a new acquaintance is unbearable.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Nothing in the text suggests that Cecily associates regret, or a feeling of sorrow, with the absence of old friends. Rather, the text sets up an ironic contrast between the feeling of calm steadiness one feels when separated from old friends and the unbearable pain of being separated from new acquaintances. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “endure” can mean persist, or proceed stubbornly, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because what is being endured is the absence of old friends. Whereas one can persist despite the absence of someone else, one can’t persist the absence itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t convey that Cecily encourages, or urges, old friends to be absent.

In reality, Bill Monroe created the bluegrass sound in the 1940s by combining Southern folk music with commercial genres that had arisen only a few decades before, such as jazz and the blues.

Researcher Kelly Bremner, however, has noted that Appia lacked technical expertise in the use of light in the theater. As a result of Appia’s inexperience, Bremner argues, Appia’s theory of light called for lighting practices that weren’t possible until after the advent of electricity around 1881.\n\nText 2\n\nAdolphe Appia was not an amateur in the practice of lighting. Instead, it is precisely his exposure to lighting techniques at the time that contributed to his theory on the importance of light.

The text focuses on something the dodder plant actively engages in—making use of a protein and producing flowers. Choice C is incorrect because stating that the dodder plant and its host engage together in “prediction,” or the act of declaring or indicating something in advance, wouldn’t make sense in context. Rather than indicating that the dodder plant and its host plant make a prediction about flowering activity, the text suggests that the host produces a protein as part of its regular flowering process and that the dodder then absorbs and uses that protein to flower at the same time.

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "rationale": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the difficulty in naming a large number of minor planets. In this context, \"insurmountable\" means impossible to overcome or too difficult to solve. The text establishes that coming up with distinct names for minor planets is already a difficult task that has become even more challenging because there are now more than 500,000 known minor planets. The logical conclusion is that finding unique names for such a vast number of celestial objects has become virtually impossible—or insurmountable—which explains why the majority of recently discovered minor planets receive only identification numbers instead of proper names.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because \"feasible\" means possible to do or achieve, which would contradict the logic of the text. The text indicates that the task of naming minor planets has become more difficult because of their large number. The text then explains that this is why most new discoveries receive only identification numbers. If the task were feasible, there would be no reason to abandon the practice of giving proper names to minor planets in favor of using only numbers. Choice C is incorrect because \"substantial\" means considerable in size, amount, or importance. While the text does suggest that naming all minor planets would be a significant undertaking, describing the task as substantial wouldn’t logically explain why the naming practice has been largely abandoned in favor of using only identification numbers. The text suggests that the task has become virtually impossible (insurmountable), not merely large or significant. Choice D is incorrect because \"unnecessary,\" which means not needed, would suggest that giving proper names to minor planets serves no purpose. However, the text doesn’t question the value or purpose of naming minor planets; rather, it explains that the sheer number of discoveries has made the already challenging naming task nearly impossible to complete. The text provides an example of a named minor planet (1227 Geranium), indicating that naming has been considered worthwhile but has become impractical because of the volume.",

Like many Impressionist painters, Degas used painted frames that stood in contrast to the gold frames frequently seen at the Paris Salon, a prestigious art exhibition that was sponsored by the French government and promoted traditional painting styles. Impressionist painters likely chose these colorful frames to distinguish themselves from what was considered conventional at the time.\n\nText 2\n\nImpressionist painters often focused on the interplay of color and light in their works. As such, those Impressionists who placed their works in painted frames instead of the more traditional gold ones did so for aesthetic reasons: a frame’s color was likely chosen because it would harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting. Gold, conversely, could distract from the subtleties in a painted scene.",

Text 1 discusses painter Edgar Degas’s insistence that his works remain in their original painted frames, which contrasted with the gold frames that were typical of the Paris art scene at the time. The text then argues that the preference of Degas and other French Impressionist painters for colorful frames can likely be attributed to their desire \"to distinguish themselves from what was considered conventional at the time.\" Text 2 also notes that Impressionist painters \"placed their works in painted frames\" but argues that they probably did so for a purely aesthetic reason: to ensure that \"the frame’s color...would harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting.\" Though differing on Impressionist painters’ rationale for using painted frames, the authors of both texts would agree that many Impressionist painters were intentional about the frames they selected for their works.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because neither text suggests that gold frames were considered desirable by those purchasing Impressionist works. Indeed, it can be inferred from the fact that Impressionist painters used painted frames that those who purchased those works wouldn’t have had a strong preference for gold frames. Choice B is incorrect because neither text suggests that Impressionist painters chose colors for their paintings based on planned frame colors. Indeed, Text 2 states that frame colors were chosen to \"harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting,\" implying that the color scheme of paintings predated and took precedence over the choice of the colors of frames. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 presents Degas’s preference for painted frames as being typical of Impressionist painters’ attitudes toward the framing of their works. Moreover, although Text 2 doesn’t specifically discuss Degas, it concurs with Text 1’s assertion that these painters preferred painted frames. Thus, both texts position painted frames as a hallmark of French Impressionist painting, not as a deviation from it.",

The text’s many examples of Julius’s usefulness reinforce just how helpful he was and in how many different ways.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t portray either the narrator’s or his wife’s reaction to their new home. Rather, the text focuses on how Julius was useful to the narrator and his wife in their new home. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that Julius was knowledgeable about the soil, this is one of several supporting details that illustrate how helpful Julius was. Moreover, the text merely states that Julius was knowledgeable about soil; it doesn’t provide an example of that knowledge. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest the frequency with which the narrator and Julius hunted and fished together. In fact, it’s unclear from the text whether the narrator and Julius hunted and fished together at all. The text merely indicates that Julius knew the best places to hunt and fish—a detail that supports the text’s main purpose by conveying Julius’s usefulness.",

She wasn’t as interested in my Barbie as she had been just two months before, which made me sad because that was the only thing Mago had envied me for. Usually, it was me doing the envying.

The underlined portion (\"which made me sad because that was the only thing Mago had envied me for\") directly expresses Grande’s unhappiness about her sister’s diminished interest in her Barbie doll. The underlined text specifically identifies that Grande feels sad and explains why Mago’s disinterest particularly affects her—because it was the one rare instance where her older sister had envied her, rather than the reverse.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the underlined portion expresses sadness, not anger. Although there is some correspondence between the emotions anger and envy and the text does indicate that Grande usually envies her sister, the underlined portion states that Grande feels sad about Mago’s disinterest in Grande’s Barbie, not angry about Mago’s refusal to spend time with her. Choice C is incorrect. While the first part of the sentence that contains the underlined portion indicates that Mago has previously taken an interest in Grande’s Barbie, implying that the sisters may regularly have played with the Barbie together in the past, the underlined portion doesn’t provide an example of this. The underlined portion instead explains why Mago’s recently developed disinterest in the Barbie saddens Grande. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole explains why Mago is unwilling to play with Grande. Rather than addressing Mago’s motivation or reasoning, the underlined portion describes Grande’s emotional reaction to Mago’s disinterest in Grande’s Barbie and explains why this lack of interest matters to Grande.",

It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say the fellowship was created to publicly alarm or surprise exceptional artists. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"familiarize\" would mean make known or familiar, but the text gives no indication that Jacobs or other recipients of the National Heritage Fellowship were unknown or unfamiliar before receiving the fellowship or that the fellowship was intended to make them familiar to the public. In fact, the text describes recipients as \"exceptional\" and notes that Jacobs received the award \"to celebrate her lifetime contributions to the arts,\" both of which suggest that Jacobs and other recipients were already well known in the arts world. Choice D is incorrect because \"convey\" would mean either transport or communicate something, neither of which would be logical in this context.

This context supports the idea that with these new data, researchers would be able to reduce, or mitigate, the identified shortcoming by incorporating a broader range of geographic regions into their studies of income inequality.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"presuppose\" would mean to assume in advance that something is true, and it wouldn’t make logical sense to say that researchers later assumed as true in advance a shortcoming they had already encountered. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"categorize\" would mean to classify or place into groups.

The author of Text 2, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the team that reported the EGR finding pointed out that while EGR’s function in humans isn’t yet known, it’s likely very different from its function in panther worms.

Although many scholars had assumed that the symbols signified entire words, linguist Alfonso Lacadena theorized in 2008 that they signified units of language smaller than words: individual syllables.\n\nText 2\n\nThe growing consensus among scholars of Nahuatl script is that many of its symbols could signify either words or syllables, depending on syntax and content at any given site within a text. For example, the symbol signifying the word huipil (blouse) in some contexts could signify the syllable “pil” in others, as in the place name “Chipiltepec.” Thus, for the Aztecs, reading required a determination of how such symbols functioned each time they appeared in a text.",

    "prompt_text": "Text 1\n\nLiterary scholars have struggled with the vastness of Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka’s collective works of drama (spanning over 20 plays in total). It is best, however, to understand Soyinka’s body of work as a dramatist chronologically. Soyinka’s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, with each one representing a particular thematic and stylistic cohesion: the 1960s, the two decades between 1970 and 1990, and lastly, from roughly 1990 onwards.\n\nText 2\n\nIt is tempting to impose a linear sense of order on the expanse of Wole Soyinka’s body of work as a dramatist. However, critics who have considered Soyinka’s plays to fit neatly into three phases overlook potential commonalities in Soyinka’s work that span across these phases. Additionally, this view may discount significant differences in the styles and content of plays written around the same time.",

This choice overstates the central claim of Text 2. The author of Text 2 argues against the chronological progression supported in Text 1, but does not go so far as to say that Soyinka’s style remained consistent. In fact, Text 2 points out “significant differences in styles and content” among Soyinka’s plays. Choice C is incorrect. Neither of the texts mention Soyinka’s poetry, nor do they rank his dramatic writing relative to his other work. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text discusses the political aspects of Soyinka’s plays, nor do they make any claims about whether they have changed over time.",

There’s no suggestion in the text that individual acts of kindness can only occur if other prosocial acts have already occurred, and the text indicates only that an act of kindness can inspire additional helpful acts, not that it necessarily will do so.

The text notes that the regional variety of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has its roots in the language of the Taínos and in the West African language of Yoruba. This context supports the idea that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced back to Yoruba.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be \"surrendered,\" or handed over on demand, to the pronunciation in Yoruba. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish has been \"announced,\" or officially declared or proclaimed. According to the text, elements of the dialect have been inherited or borrowed from African languages, and the relationship between the pronunciation of certain vowels in the Puerto Rican dialect and in Yoruba is an example of this inheritance, suggesting that the pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced to Yoruba.

Generally, when prices rise, demand falls—but the text indicates that in this case, buyers who previously had no interest in cassettes \"thronged the market\" (that is, many of them began purchasing cassettes) because they saw the cassettes as potential investments. This context conveys that the rising prices surprisingly produced significant demand, producing many new buyers for vintage cassettes.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a rise in prices of vintage cassettes, and it wouldn’t make sense to describe the price increase itself—rather than sellers of vintage cassettes—as \"exploiting,\" or unfairly or selfishly taking advantage of, demand. Further, wanting to take advantage of new demand would be a motivation for a price increase, not a counterintuitive effect of it. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, \"monetizing\" would mean utilizing as a source of profit, and it wouldn’t make sense to describe a price increase itself, rather than sellers of vintage cassettes, as using demand as a source of profit; moreover, seeking to profit when there’s new demand would be a reason for price increases, not a counterintuitive effect of them. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"appraising\" would mean assessing the value or significance of something. The text focuses on a rise in prices of vintage cassettes, and while it would be reasonable to suggest that sellers might have appraised demand for those cassettes, it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that a price increase itself could do such an assessment; moreover, an appraisal of demand would most likely precede a price increase rather than be an effect of it.",

By emphasizing the contributions of these leaders, historians have in effect minimized the contributions of ordinary workers, treating them as relatively unimportant and \"nearly devoid of agency,\" thereby marginalizing them.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In this context, \"epitomize\" would mean either serve as an ideal example of something or make into an example of something, neither of which would make sense. In stating that historians have tended to characterize political, business, and labor leaders as the primary actors responsible for changes in the post-Second World War labor movement in a manner that minimizes the influence of ordinary workers, the text suggests that historians have tended to present ordinary workers as unimportant to or uninfluential within the movement, not that historians themselves serve as examples of ordinary workers, or that historians in their analyses have made ordinary workers into examples of the changes that occurred. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"extol\" would mean praise highly or glorify. The text states that historians have tended to present ordinary workers as being \"nearly devoid of agency,\" thereby minimizing their importance. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that in doing so, historians have tended to praise or glorify them. Choice D is incorrect because \"substantiate\" would mean verify with evidence, and nothing in the text suggests that historians have verified rank-and-file workers or their contributions in their analyses.

The text goes on to say, however, that Jha and Kremen identified a circumstance in which bees don’t behave this way.

In this context, “engulfs” would mean encloses or overwhelms, and although it is fairly common to describe an actor as embodying (or personifying realistically) a character, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the cast members enclosed or overwhelmed the characters they played. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “encourages” would mean inspires with courage or hope. Although the text does mention “a strong mother and several daughters dealing with individual struggles,” which might suggest that there are moments of encouragement among the characters during the play, there is nothing to suggest that the cast members encouraged the characters they portrayed.

Text 1 indicates that Storey found a genetic mutation in South American chickens from before the European invasion and in Polynesian chickens, which implies that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian people. Text 2 explains that the genetic mutation Storey found is in chickens from all over the world, thus undercutting the mutation as evidence of a Polynesian origin. However, Text 2 goes on to say “[m]ore recently” Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues found multiple genetic markers shared by South American and Polynesian chickens but “that European breeds lack,” which strongly suggests a Polynesian origin for the South American chickens. This indicates that the author of Text 2 believes Luzuriaga-Neira’s evidence for a Polynesian origin is compelling while Storey’s evidence has been undermined. Thus, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with the underlined statement and believes Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues’ evidence for the statement is stronger than Storey’s evidence is.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because both texts indicate that chickens were introduced to South America before the arrival of Europeans. Text 1 states that the El Arenal chicken bone dates from “1321–1407 CE—over a century before Europeans invaded the region” and concludes that these chickens were likely brought to South America by Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the time period as Text 1 is, nothing in Text 2 undermines the timing of events ascribed to Storey’s account in Text 1. Choice B is incorrect because both texts agree that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian peoples (the underlined claim), and nothing in Text 2 suggests that this claim is in any way deficient because the possibility that animals could have been transferred from South America to Polynesia was not explicitly addressed. Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specifically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens.

Thus, the main purpose of the text is to illustrate Louis’s dedicated focus on getting people to sign the petition.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text suggests that Louis was aggressive in seeking signatures for the petition—for example, saying that he \"cornered\" people—nothing in the text addresses how those people feel toward Louis, let alone that they are refusing his request. Choice B is incorrect because, other than portraying Louis’s commitment to gathering signatures, the text doesn’t discuss community members’ attitudes toward Louis or the petition. Choice C is incorrect because the text never mentions the attitudes of the people Louis approaches toward the petition, but the text does indicate that he \"cornered\" prospective signatories, strongly suggesting that their enthusiasm was neither needed nor considered.",

Text 1 begins by asserting that the unintended transfer of feelings from one person to another, known as emotional contagion, seems to rely on both people being physically present and able to observe body language. Text 1 then references research that supports this assertion. Text 2 describes an experiment conducted by the researchers Yang and Ferrara in which they found evidence of emotional contagion in the absence of physical interaction, namely through text-based interactions on social media. The researchers in Text 2 wouldn’t completely agree with what is asserted in the underlined portion of Text 1 (that emotional contagion seems to require physical proximity), because their study, which used a social media networking service, found that physical interaction isn’t the only way that emotional contagion can take place. Thus, the researchers in Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by stating that it reflects an incomplete view of emotional contagion, because the phenomenon can occur without an in-person interaction.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the researchers in Text 2 would likely agree that the underlined statement in Text 1 perpetuates a flawed conclusion that emotional contagion requires physical interaction, Text 2 doesn’t address what the researchers thought about smiling as a sign of emotional contagion. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers in Text 2 wouldn’t say that the underlined claim in Text 1 is fairly persuasive. According to Text 2, the researchers conducted a study that found emotional contagion didn’t require physical interaction, because they found evidence of it in text-based online interactions. Choice D is incorrect because neither of the texts claim that emotional contagion primarily occurs when a person is exposed to negativity.

Text 1 discusses the lack of knowledge of how plate tectonics on Earth began. Text 1 also mentions researchers who contend that movements of tectonic plates began around 3 billion years ago. As support for this assertion, these researchers cite computer models (which are simulations, not empirical evidence) of the temperature in Earth’s mantle that show that at that time, the mantle would have been sufficiently molten for plates to move. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that empirical evidence from the geological record is necessary to make plausible claims about when tectonic movement began. Text 2 mentions an analysis performed by Wriju Chowdhury and his team of the geochemistry of zircon crystals (which would constitute empirical evidence). Chowdhury and his team argue, based on this analysis, that tectonic plates may have begun to move as early as 4.2 billion years ago.

Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 claims that empirical evidence is needed to fix the earliest date of tectonic movement. Computer models are simulations, not empirical evidence, so the author of Text 2 wouldn’t distinguish between different kinds of computer models but would instead argue that no computer models can reliably predict the onset of plate tectonics. Choice C is incorrect because the author of Text 2 wouldn’t consider any computer model to be able to provide evidence to support a plausible claim about tectonic movement, no matter how much such models were improved.

There’s no contrast between saying that the mammals weren’t localized and the mammals being varied.

Jazz tap was heavily influenced by jazz music, which became widely popular in the United States in the 1920s. Tap dancers were inspired by jazz music’s quick rhythms and by the way jazz musicians would make up melodies as they played. As jazz music continued to develop in the 1930s and 1940s, jazz tap evolved with it.

Since the delays are an inanimate circumstance, they couldn’t argue against a prediction about the sales of personal electronics. Choice B is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to “withdraw,” or remove from consideration, the economist’s projection wouldn’t make sense.

It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November, wouldn’t it? Look at these maple branches. Don’t they give you a thrill—several thrills? I’m going to decorate my room with them.”\n\n“Messy things,” said Marilla, whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably developed. “You clutter up your room entirely too much with out-of-doors stuff, Anne.

It then relates a scene when she enthusiastically enters the house with autumn foliage and announces that she will decorate her room with it. The focus of the text then shifts to Marilla, who has an undeveloped “aesthetic sense,” or appreciation of beauty, as can be seen when she dismisses the maple leaves as “messy things” and criticizes Anne for cluttering her room with objects from outside. This episode thus illustrates that Anne and Marilla differ in their appreciation of beauty and, more generally, in their basic character: Anne is exuberant and joyful, while Marilla is stern and critical. Therefore, the purpose of the text is to show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text presents Anne’s appreciation of nature as a basic personality trait, not as a newfound enthusiasm, and never indicates how recently she developed that appreciation. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text portrays Anne and Marilla as having different personalities and attitudes toward natural beauty and home decoration, it doesn’t show them engaging in an argument about this difference or suggest that they often argue about it.

The text goes on to explain that having a large amount of stored solar energy can lessen the negative effect of \"unpredictable shifts in cloud cover and haze\"—that is, unpredictable changes in environmental conditions that at times limit sunlight. This context suggests that having ample solar energy stored and ready to use can mitigate the issue of fluctuations in solar energy collection caused by irregular patterns of sunlight availability.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"developments of solar energy collection\" would most clearly refer to the creation of ways to collect solar energy (energy captured from sunlight). The text focuses on collection and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight (\"cloud cover and haze\"); there’s no reason to think that the creation of new collection methods would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated.

Although the text indicates that the new picture is different from the other items in the shop, there’s no suggestion that the shop owner prizes either the new picture or the pictures of the city, pets, and landscapes more than he prizes any other items. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe what the new picture looks like; rather, the text identifies some of the other kinds of images that the shop owner has and states that they’re different from the new picture without explaining how they’re different.",

    "prompt_text": "The people of medieval Europe have traditionally been seen as uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene, but modern research has shown that this is largely a myth. According to historian Eleanor Janega, most medieval towns in Europe had at least one public bathhouse, which often offered both full-immersion baths and—more affordably—steam baths. While such amenities were available mainly to town dwellers, regular bathing in rivers and streams or daily sponge baths at home were common practices throughout medieval Europe.",

      "It concedes that not all people in medieval Europe had access to public bathhouses.",
      "It explains why Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe."
    ],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "rationale": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively describes the function of the underlined portion. The text discusses the long-standing misconception that people in medieval Europe were uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene. As evidence that this idea is false, the text cites historian Eleanor Janega’s assertion that in medieval Europe, towns usually had at least one bathhouse, where people could take immersion baths or steam baths for a fee. The underlined portion then notes that mainly town dwellers had access to these bathhouses. The remainder of the text explains that those who lacked such access were nonetheless able to bathe in outdoor waterways or take sponge baths at home. Therefore, the underlined portion concedes that some people in medieval Europe lacked access to public bathhouses.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The underlined portion establishes that amenities such as steam baths were mainly available to town dwellers, which suggests in turn that steam baths were largely unavailable to people in rural areas. Thus, the distinction made by the underlined portion is not between the popularity of steam baths in towns versus their lack of popularity in rural areas but instead between their presence in towns and absence in rural areas. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does explain that recent historians have disproved the idea that medieval Europeans rarely bathed, it doesn’t attribute that misconception to earlier historians of medieval Europe or suggest that their research was subject to limitations. Moreover, the underlined portion addresses a limitation of life in medieval Europe, not of historical research. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t address why historian Eleanor Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe—nor does any portion of the text. The text mentions Janega in passing, but it doesn’t go into detail about why she decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe.",

The point of the text is that the view of the Port of Oakland from the subway train as it rises from underground is significant to Moss, not whether it is described as being correct, which the text does not address.",

In this context, \"accidental\" means unplanned or unintentional. The text first describes Bastos’s study, which concerns a kea that is observed using small stones to preen its feathers. The text then mentions colleagues who are skeptical (that is, they have doubt) about Bastos’s findings, and finally describes how Bastos and her team responded to the skepticism of those colleagues. Given that the colleagues mentioned in the text expressed skepticism regarding Bastos’s findings, the best answer choice must be one that completes the text in a manner such that the skeptics’ opinion regarding the kea’s use of stones disagrees with that held by Bastos and her team. Since Bastos and her team showed that the kea’s use of stones was deliberate (that is, intentional), the skeptics’ opinion in this context must be that the kea’s use of stones was unintentional, or accidental.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the best answer choice is one that portrays skepticism, or doubt, of Bastos’s claim that the kea’s usage of stones was deliberate, or intentional. If the skeptics found the kea’s usage of stones \"intriguing,\" or fascinating, this would not be at odds with the position of Bastos and her team; in fact, it is reasonable to believe that someone who agreed that the kea’s stone usage was deliberate would also find it intriguing. Choice B is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea’s usage of small stones was \"obvious,\" or evident, this would not be contrary to the observation of Bastos and her team that the kea’s usage of stones was deliberate: in fact, these opinions would be consistent with each other. Choice D is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea’s usage of small stones was \"observable,\" or visible, this would not conflict with the claim of Bastos and her team that the kea’s usage of stones was deliberate: instead, these positions would agree.",

If anything, the text suggests that she may have found some of these topics to be dull, saying that she even read the \"dry ones\"—that is, the boring books—and that some of the books were \"hard going,\" meaning they were difficult to get through.

Ecologists’ many efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven’t uncovered a satisfactory explanation.\n\nText 2\n\nEcologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have connected phytoplankton’s diversity to their microscopic size. Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn makes it hard for them to move around and interact with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld’s team, direct competition among phytoplankton probably happens much less than previously thought.",

In other words, the text indicates that one of the supposed benefits of Alice’s plan is that it can be easily arranged.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text describes how Alice’s plan can be arranged, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that it can be arranged “faintly,” or with little strength or not strongly. Instead, the text indicates that the plan can be arranged with little difficulty. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “simply” can mean quickly, hastily, or hurriedly, the word “hastily” indicates that something is done too quickly. Although it may be true that Alice’s plan was made in haste, the text doesn’t focus on this aspect of her plan.

The text explains that although skeptics had thought that direct evidence of gravitational waves would be too faint to be detected, researchers led by González claimed that a chirping sound captured by Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory antennas nevertheless provided such evidence. The text goes on to say that detailed statistical analysis confirmed the observation of gravitational waves with a high degree of confidence—that is, with near certainty—a finding that helped to preclude, or rule out, any claims that the signal’s attribution to gravitational waves might be ambiguous or doubtful.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In this context, \"inconspicuousness\" would mean the quality of being unnoticeable or difficult to detect. Although the text indicates that skeptics had doubted whether gravitational waves could be observed directly because of their presumed faintness (which suggests that gravitational waves were expected to be difficult to detect), the blank portion of the text isn’t referring to the possibility that gravitational waves are unnoticeable or undetectable. Instead, the focus of the last sentence is González’s team’s observation of a chirping sound that they attributed to gravitational waves, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that through statistical analysis, they ruled out the possibility that the sound they observed was undetectable. Rather, the skeptical view presented in the text suggests that there could be some ambiguity about the source of the chirping, but statistical analysis virtually eliminated this uncertainty. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"discretion\" would mean good judgment, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that an event, such as the detection of gravitational waves, would show judgment, much less that the event’s capacity to exercise good judgment would be precluded by statistical analysis confirming its attribution. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"probability\" would mean likelihood, and the text states that statistical analysis, which confirmed the signal with a high degree of confidence, suggests the likelihood that the chirping sound was produced by gravitational waves, not that the analysis helped to preclude this likelihood.",

The text indicates that Xoconochco was located on a coast, hundreds of kilometers away from the capital of the Aztec Empire. The text also states that trade between the province and the capital required “a long overland journey.” This context suggests that Xoconochco was situated toward an edge of the empire’s territory rather than near its center.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to refer to Xoconochco’s location within the Aztec Empire as “unobtrusive,” or not blatant or undesirably prominent; it’s not clear how a province’s physical location would or wouldn’t be blatant. Instead of focusing on how noticeable Xoconochco’s location was, the text emphasizes the province’s distance from the capital of the empire, pointing out that because of this distance trade between the two required “a long overland journey.” Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the province of Xoconochco was located on a coast far from the capital of the Aztec Empire, not that it was “concealed,” or kept out of sight or hidden from view. Nothing in the text suggests that Xoconochco was actually hidden such that people couldn’t see it, and being hidden wouldn’t necessarily result in trade between the province and the capital requiring “a long overland journey.” Choice C is incorrect because to say that Xoconochco’s location within the Aztec Empire was “approximate” would mean that the location either wasn’t precisely correct or was close to some other location. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text indicates that Xoconochco’s location is known and that it was far from the empire’s capital, so there’s no reason to characterize the location as either not precisely correct or close to another location.",

In this context the word \"impending\" means imminent or approaching. The text mentions a study by Leka and colleagues that found that the Sun’s corona provides an advance indication of solar flares. The text then points out why such an advance indication would be useful—solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth—and concludes by describing the characteristic of the corona that gives warning of a solar flare. The text indicates that this characteristic—increased brightness in a particular region of the corona—comes before the appearance of the flare. Therefore, in context, the best answer would indicate that the flare is approaching, or impending.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The best answer would be one that indicates that the increased brightness of the Sun’s corona precedes the appearance of the flare. But if the flare were \"antecedent,\" or previous, then the flare would instead precede the appearance of the increased brightness of the corona, a statement that is logically inconsistent. Choice C is incorrect. The word \"innocuous,\" or harmless, does not logically complete the text; since solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth, they cannot reasonably be described as innocuous.

The tools were found in a layer of earth that is over 33,000 years old—much older than the Clovis people’s arrival 13,000 years ago. The text ends with the claim that the tools reveal that humans lived in the cave long before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the idea that the stone pieces are definitely tools. Text 2 states that the pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply naturally broken off from rocks and, moreover, that no other signs of human activity have been found in the cave. In other words, Text 2 argues that there is no proof yet that humans made the pieces as tools or were even present in the cave.

Further, the author of Text 2 makes no mention of the Clovis people and indicates that it isn’t clear yet that any human group did inhabit Chiquihuite Cave. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author believes the stone pieces probably are human-made tools and will be confirmed as such by further analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasizes the current lack of evidence of human activity in the cave.

Throughout, the text emphasizes how deeply the queen is affected by both Aeneas’s tale and persona. At the outset, the speaker explicitly states that \"anxious cares...seiz’d the queen\" and then uses the metaphor of fire (\"within her veins a flame unseen\" and \"secret fire\") to evoke the warmth of Dido’s feelings for Aeneas. In addition, the line \"His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart\" suggests the deep impression that Aeneas’s story makes on Dido, eliciting passion for him (\"improv[ing] the passion\") and empathy for his suffering (\"increas[ing] the smart\").\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there’s no indication in the text that Dido is skeptical of Aeneas’s account, much less that she’s trying to conceal that skepticism. On the contrary, the text shows her being moved by his words and developing feelings for him. Choice C is incorrect. While the text mentions that Dido is impressed by Aeneas’s \"valor, acts, and birth,\" which might suggest (but doesn’t necessarily entail) intellectual engagement, the text doesn’t represent Dido’s engagement with Aeneas in a manner that suggests a balance between emotion and intellect. Rather, the text primarily emphasizes her emotional response—specifically her attraction to Aeneas and her emotional investment in his story, indicating that his \"valor, acts, and birth inspire / Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire\" and that his words and looks elicit passion and empathy. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Dido is worried about Aeneas discovering a secret she is concealing from him. Though the text begins by mentioning Dido’s \"anxious cares,\" this refers to her growing passion for Aeneas and pity for his suffering, not to worry about a secret she is concealing. The text’s reference to a \"flame unseen\" and \"secret fire\" points to Dido’s growing feelings for Aeneas that develop as he recounts his tale, not to a secret that existed before their encounter; moreover, the text provides no indication that Dido is worried Aeneas might discover these feelings.",

Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Potvin and colleagues’ perspective in Text 1 by saying that the behavior of the magpies without trackers could be adequately explained without suggesting that they were attempting to assist the other magpie.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses the novelty, or the newness and unusual quality, of the captive settings in which animals have been observed to remove trackers from other animals, nor does it suggest that such novelty might account for this behavior. Instead, the text suggests that it’s the novelty of the tracking equipment itself that might cause the behavior: interested in the trackers because they’re unusual, animals might paw or peck at them until they fall off. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never suggests that when animals remove trackers from other animals, they do so because they wish to obtain the trackers for themselves. Instead, Text 2 argues that animals paw or peck at trackers because they are merely curious about them. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn’t argue that when captured animals are observed removing trackers from each other, their behavior should be regarded as selfless only if all of them participate in it.

The first part of the text presents the favorable opinions that others hold of Mr. Ely: the laity of Milby regard him as having \"remarkable powers and learning\" and assume that he also impresses people in London, while his fellow clergy see him as \"a discreet and agreeable fellow.\" The text then goes on to describe Mr. Ely’s behaviors that enable him to cultivate and preserve his positive reputation. The text conveys that he avoids confrontations, abstaining from \"warm discussion[s]\" (that is, heated or contentious ones); that he avoids offending anyone by \"rarely [saying] what he thought himself\" and by refraining from openly ridiculing anyone; and that he doesn’t give anyone any reason to ridicule or belittle his own character (\"he never gave any one an opportunity of laughing at him\"). In other words, these are all behaviors that suggest that Mr. Ely avoids doing anything that might make people dislike him or think poorly of him. Thus, the text begins by presenting the favorable view that people have of Mr. Ely and then describes the behaviors that enable him to maintain that favorable view.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe any events that caused people’s regard for Mr. Ely to diminish. Instead, the text explains that the people of Milby hold him in high regard and describes behaviors that suggest how he cultivates that regard. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Mr. Ely’s neighbors are more naïve than Londoners are or that they’ve been misled. Although the text suggests that Mr. Ely is very guarded in his outward behavior and conceals from people when he may be internally mocking them, which might suggest that people know him less well than they think they do, there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Londoners are less naïve and therefore less easily misled than Mr. Ely’s neighbors are. The text states that the people of Milby believe Mr. Ely to be \"remarkable\" and that they assume that people in London must find him so, too; it doesn’t say anything about what Londoners actually think of him. Choice C is incorrect. While the text discusses Mr. Ely’s public conduct at length, describing the ways in which he carefully cultivates an agreeable public persona, the text doesn’t discuss how Mr. Ely behaves in private at all; it therefore wouldn’t be accurate to say that the text begins by emphasizing a discrepancy between his public and private conduct. Furthermore, although the text concludes with examples illustrating that Mr. Ely typically doesn’t share his true thoughts, indicating that he may be hiding aspects of his true personality when in public, and although the text as a whole conveys the idea that Mr. Ely benefits from this behavior, which might hint at his motives for doing so, the text doesn’t conclude by alluding to those motives. Instead, the text merely concludes with a description of the behaviors he engages in to win his neighbors’ and colleagues’ approval.",

This comparison conveys that the speaker views the concepts of love, April, and the gold of someone’s hair as being blended together, or combined.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \"mingled\" means combined, not identified.

The text as a whole may refer to a memory, but the comparison of the mingling of several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone’s hair) to \"the blending of\" a plant and the scent of a flower conveys that the speaker views those concepts as actually blended together, or combined, and not simply remembered at the same time. Choice D is incorrect. The speaker refers to several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone’s hair) and then compares the mingling together of those concepts to \"the blending of\" a plant and the scent of a flower; rather than suggesting that the concepts are celebrated, this comparison conveys that the speaker views the concepts as blended together, or combined.",

She then states that she rehearses \"the small world’s scheme\"—that is, imagines moving through her mental map—and challenges herself to use the map in her mind while lying in bed at night. The underlined portion presents two such challenges (getting to the store through backyards and traveling from school to a friend’s house) and thus provides examples of what the narrator thinks about at night.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the underlined portion makes no mention of memorizing a telephone number. Although the narrator mentions that she had to learn the home telephone number before her mother would give her permission to walk around the neighborhood, there is nothing in the underlined portion or the rest of the text about memorizing the telephone number. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion refers to navigation tasks like finding a route to a store only through backyards, the text contains no specific directions to any store, nor is any store identified as the narrator’s favorite.

In this context, “negligible” means not significant enough to be worth considering. The text says that the study challenged the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. The text goes on to say that the researchers found that “in fact, as many as half” the hunters in the groups studied were female. The phrase “in fact” establishes a contrast indicating that the finding that as many as half the hunters were female differs from the accepted view. This context suggests, then, that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was negligible. \n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among prehistoric peoples were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was “inevitable,” or unavoidable. Nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view is that prehistoric peoples could not avoid female participation in hunting. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples is that such participation was “satisfactory,” or sufficient to meet a requirement or demand. There is no information in the text about any demands or requirements regarding female participation in hunting, let alone any information about how much female participation in hunting would be enough to satisfy those demands or requirements. Instead, the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half the hunters in the groups studied were female, suggesting that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was low. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among the prehistoric peoples studied were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was “commonplace,” or ordinary or unremarkable.

The text states that although members of the Igun Eronmwon guild typically do something with techniques that have been passed down since the thirteenth century, they “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” By establishing a contrast with not always following traditions, the context suggests that guild members do typically adhere to traditional techniques.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context “experiment with” would mean to do something new with. Although using motors rather than manual bellows is presented as a new approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” The phrase “experiment with” wouldn’t support the contrast because regularly trying new things with the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions.

This context supports the idea that Kim’s novel features three distinct perspectives.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim’s novel as \"required,\" or demanded as necessary to be done or provided, wouldn’t make sense in context. When writing a novel, a novelist is free to choose to narrate the story from any number of perspectives. There’s nothing in the text to indicate that providing three perspectives was demanded of Kim.

Choice C is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim’s novel as \"unintended,\" or not planned as a purpose or goal, wouldn’t make sense in context. Authors make deliberate choices about the perspectives they feature in their works, and the text indicates that Kim chose to incorporate three different perspectives in her novel.

Instead, these two examples work together to support the claim made in the first sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea.

The comma after \"described\" separates the first supplementary element (\"both of interviewees and the items they described\") from the second supplementary element (\"from hair to grass to sculptures\"). Furthermore, the dash after \"sculptures\" pairs with the dash after \"photographs\" to separate these two supplementary elements from the rest of the sentence. The pair of dashes, which operate at a higher organizing level than the comma, indicates that the elements between the dashes function together—in this case, the second supplement (\"from…sculptures\") describes the range of items mentioned in the first supplement—and could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it fails to appropriately punctuate the supplementary elements in the sentence. A dash is needed after \"sculptures\" to separate the supplementary elements (\"both…sculptures\") from the rest of the sentence. Choice C is incorrect because it fails to appropriately punctuate the supplementary elements in the sentence. The two supplementary elements \"both…described\" and \"from…sculptures\" function together to describe the photographs, and placing a dash between them would make this relationship less clear, suggesting that the supplement \"both...described\" is a standalone element that could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence, which isn’t the case. Choice D is incorrect because it fails to appropriately punctuate the supplementary elements in the sentence. A colon isn’t conventionally used in this way to separate a supplementary element (\"from hair to grass to sculptures\") from the noun phrase it is modifying (\"items they described\").

Choice B is incorrect. Joining the main clause (“scholar…materialism”) and the following noun phrase with the conjunction “and” results in a confusing and illogical sentence that suggests that the novel depicts the upper classes of New York society as “an apt assessment,” which doesn’t make sense in this context.

So the simple past tense “leveraged” fits the logic of the text.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. “Has leveraged” is the present perfect tense, which is used for an action that began in the past and continues into the present. Lincoln started leveraging his rivals’ talents in 1860—it’s definitely not still happening today. So the present perfect tense isn’t appropriate. Choice B is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. “Is leveraging” is the present tense, but Lincoln leveraged his rivals’ talents in 1860, so the present tense isn’t appropriate. Choice C is incorrect. This choice creates a tense issue. “Will leverage” is the future tense, but Lincoln leveraged his rivals’ talents in 1860, so the future tense isn’t appropriate.",
